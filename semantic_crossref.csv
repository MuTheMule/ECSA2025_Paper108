Resilience Framework for Power Electronic Systems Against Cyber-Physical Attacks: A Review,"This paper presents a systematic overview of the resilience framework for power electronics converter-based cyber-physical systems (CPSs), emphasizing end-to-end responses to the emerging challenges posed by cyber-physical attacks. While recent advancements in control and communication have enhanced the functionalities of power electronic converters in applications such as electric vehicles and smart grids, such advancements have also introduced new vulnerabilities, particularly to cyber-physical attacks. The existing literature tends to focus on isolated research areas, and a comprehensive review that encompasses strategies applicable before, during, and after an attack remains lacking. To address this gap, this paper categorizes state-of-the-art research into four key stages of an attack: anticipate and prepare, resist and absorb, detect and evaluate, and recover. Topics reviewed in this paper include converter and cyber-physical attack modeling, converter-based CPS testbeds, system hardening at the cyber and physical layers, attack detection, post-attack evaluation, and recovery strategies. Real-world case studies and practical regulations are also analyzed. Additionally, challenges and opportunities of the resilience framework are discussed. Despite notable advancements in modeling and identifying cyber-physical attacks, considerable efforts are still required to improve attack mitigation strategies and recovery mechanisms.","Chang Liu, Jin Ye, Gaoliang Fang, Di Wang, Linke Zhou, A.

Resilience analysis of cyber‐physical systems: A review of models and methods,"Cyber‐physical systems (CPSs) are monitored and controlled by a computing and communicating core. This cyber layer enables better management of the controlled subsystem, but it also introduces threats to the security and protection of CPSs, as demonstrated by recent cyberattacks. The resulting governance and policy emphasis on cybersecurity is reflected in the academia by a vast body of literature. In this article, we systematize existing knowledge on CPS analysis. Specifically, we focus on the quantitative assessment of CPSs before and after the occurrence of a disruption. Through the systematic analysis of the models and methods adopted in the literature, we develop a CPS resilience assessment framework consisting of three steps, namely, (1) CPS description, (2) disruption scenario identification, and (3) resilience strategy selection. For each step of the framework, we suggest established methods for CPS analysis and suggest four criteria for method selection. The framework proposes a standardized workflow to assess the resilience of CPSs before and after the occurrence of a disruption. The application of the proposed framework is exemplified with reference to a power substation and associated communication network.The case study shows that the proposed framework supports resilience decision making by quantifying the effects of the implementation of resilience strategies.","B.

Hash-MAC-DSDV: Mutual Authentication for Intelligent IoT-Based Cyber–Physical Systems,"Cyber–physical systems (CPS) connected in the form of Internet of Things (IoT) are vulnerable to various security threats, due to the infrastructure-less deployment of IoT devices. Device-to-Device (D2D) authentication of these networks ensures the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of information in the deployed area. The literature suggests different approaches to address security issues in CPS technologies. However, they are mostly based on centralized techniques or specific system deployments with a higher cost of computation and communication. It is therefore necessary to develop an effective scheme that can resolve the security problems in CPS technologies of IoT devices. In this article, a lightweight hash media access control destination sequence distance vector (Hash-MAC-DSDV) routing scheme is proposed to resolve authentication issues in CPS technologies, connected in the form of IoT networks. For this purpose, a CPS of IoT devices (multi-WSNs) is developed from the local chain and public chain, respectively. The proposed scheme ensures D2D authentication by the Hash-MAC-DSDV mutual scheme, where the MAC addresses of individual devices are registered in the first phase and advertised in the network in the second phase. The proposed scheme allows legitimate devices to modify their routing table and unicast the one-way hash authentication mechanism to transfer their captured data from the source toward the destination. Our evaluation results demonstrate that Hash-MAC-DSDV outweighs the existing schemes in terms of attack detection, energy consumption, and communication metrics.","M. Adil, M.

An STL-based Formulation of Resilience in Cyber-Physical Systems,"Resiliency is the ability to quickly recover from a violation and avoid future violations for as long as possible. Such a property is of fundamental importance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and yet, to date, there is no widely agreed-upon formal treatment of CPS resiliency. We present an STL-based framework for reasoning about resiliency in CPS in which resiliency has a syntactic characterization in the form of an STL-based Resiliency Specification (SRS). Given an arbitrary STL formula $\varphi$, time bounds $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the SRS of $\varphi$, $R_{\alpha,\beta}(\varphi)$, is the STL formula $\neg\varphi\mathbf{U}_{[0,\alpha]}\mathbf{G}_{[0,\beta)}\varphi$, specifying that recovery from a violation of $\varphi$ occur within time $\alpha$ (recoverability), and subsequently that $\varphi$ be maintained for duration $\beta$ (durability). These $R$-expressions, which are atoms in our SRS logic, can be combined using STL operators, allowing one to express composite resiliency specifications, e.g., multiple SRSs must hold simultaneously, or the system must eventually be resilient. We define a quantitative semantics for SRSs in the form of a Resilience Satisfaction Value (ReSV) function $r$ and prove its soundness and completeness w.r.t. STL's Boolean semantics. The $r$-value for $R_{\alpha,\beta}(\varphi)$ atoms is a singleton set containing a pair quantifying recoverability and durability. The $r$-value for a composite SRS formula results in a set of non-dominated recoverability-durability pairs, given that the ReSVs of subformulas might not be directly comparable (e.g., one subformula has superior durability but worse recoverability than another). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-dimensional quantitative semantics for an STL-based logic. Two case studies demonstrate the practical utility of our approach.","Hongkai Chen, Shanny Lin, S. Smolka, Nicola Paoletti Stony Brook University, S. Brook, Usa, R. Holloway, U. O.

Featuring Dual Learning Experiences in Tangible CPS Education: A Synchronized Internet-of-Things – Digital-Twin System,"Cyber-Physical System (CPS) development becomes challenging when digital representations, so-called Digital Twin (DT) models, are synchronized with physical counterparts for real-time design and control. Learner support requires transparent and intelligible capacity building tools to grasp the idea of such complex systems and develop integrated design and engineering skills. Tangible components can help as physical cognitive artifacts for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications being part of CPS. However, the intertwining of physical and digital elements requires a didactically grounded vocabulary and development concept to learn with tangible artifacts as mental representation. In this paper we introduce an integrated tangible design and engineering learning support system.

A Resilient and Robust Edge-Cloud Network System Supporting CPS,"Many outages of cloud computing services are caused by the natural disasters or common causes such as software failure, hardware failure, cyber attacks, and power outage. As a result, it is critical to develop resilient and robust cyber-physical system (CPS) to support continuity of service for smart and connected communities (S&CC). In spite of considerate research efforts on virtual machine (VM) migration for enhancing failure-resilience of datacenters, one issue still needs to be effectively addressed: how to determine the best destination for VM migration to avoid the influence from a given failure and enable edge nodes to connect to the VMs continuously. In this paper, we aim to handle these important issues to build a resilient and robust edge-cloud (or fog) network system supporting CPS for S&CC. We propose a machine learning based method for VM migration destination determination for the VMs in the predicted failure domains. We also propose a continuous edge-cloud connection method in wireless network component that enables edge nodes to continuously connect with the VMs through intermediate edge nodes when they cannot directly connect to their original VMs due to VM migration.

CapOS: Capacitor Error Resilience for Energy Harvesting Systems,"Energy harvesting systems have emerged as an alternative to battery-operated Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To deal with frequent power outages in the absence of battery, energy harvesting systems rely on a capacitor-backed checkpoint mechanism also known as just-in-time (JIT) checkpointing. It checkpoints volatile data in nonvolatile memory (NVM) just before a power outage occurs—using the energy buffered in the capacitor—and restores the checkpointed data from NVM in the wake of the outage. While the JIT checkpointing gives an illusion that volatile data survive a power outage as if they were nonvolatile, it turns out that due to capacitor degradation, energy harvesting systems can unexpectedly fail the JIT checkpointing, losing or corrupting data across the outage. To address the problem, this article presents an operating system-driven solution called CapOS. At a high level, CapOS diagnoses the capacitor in a reactive yet safe manner. When the JIT checkpoint failure occurs, CapOS detects the capacitor degradation without causing the data corruption. To recover from such a capacitor error, CapOS electrically isolates the degraded capacitor—so that it restores its original capacitance by itself with the help of capacitor’s resilient nature—and disables the JIT checkpointing. In case, power outages occur during the capacitor isolation, CapOS leverages undo logging with interval-based checkpointing for their recovery. Once the capacitor is fully recovered, CapOS gets back to the capacitor-based JIT checkpointing. The experimental results demonstrate that CapOS can effectively address the capacitor error of energy harvesting systems at a low run-time cost, without compromising the recovery of power outages.","Jongouk Choi, Hyunwoo Joe, Changhee Jung",2022.0,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,10.1109/TCAD.2022.3202861,Semantic Scholar,8.0
Introduction to the Special Issue on Memory and Storage Systems for Embedded and IoT Applications: Part 2,"With the rapid advances in sensing and communication technologies, embedded systems (e.g., IoT and edge devices) have evolved tremendously in recent years. However, data-intensive applications are used more and more on such platforms. Yet embedded systems usually have limited energy, computing power, and memory/storage space. Thus, new memory and storage devices/technologies have emerged to improve performance, reduce energy consumption, and increase memory/storage capacity of embedded systems for novel embedded and IoT applications. This is the second part of the Special Issue on Memory and Storage Systems for Embedded and IoT Applications. It includes four articles that tackle some of the most recent and impactful topics and design issues of memory and storage systems for embedded and IoT applications, including in-storage computing for learning algorithms, page fault handling against CPS malware, simulation for ReRAM-based accelerators, and data management of blockchain. “Store-n-Learn: Classification and Clustering with Hyperdimensional Computing across Flash Hierarchy” proposes “Store-n-Learn” design (i.e., an in-storage computing solution) that performs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) classification and clustering by implementing encoding, training, retraining, and inference across the flash hierarchy. The proposed Store-n-Learn design exploits the internal bandwidth and hierarchical structure of SSDs to perform HDC classification and clustering in storage, so as to improve the performance of HDC classification. The article “Physics-driven Page Fault Handling for Customized Deception against CPS Malware” considers the page fault handling technique against CPS malware. To counter CPS malware, a physics-driven page fault handler in the seL4 microkernel is developed to differentiate active physics (data) in main memory from passive physics (data) in the backing store and to aid in the identification of active physics via a CPU scheduler that tracks the evolution of active physics over time. “DL-RSIM: A Reliability and Deployment Strategy Simulation Framework for ReRAM-based CNN Accelerators” aims to enable reliable and energy-efficient memristor-based accelerators. It develops a simulation platform that precisely analyzes the impact of non-ideal circuit/device properties on the inference accuracy and the influence of different deployment strategies on performance and energy consumption. A flexible simulation framework, DL-RSIM, is proposed to support a rich set of reliability impact factors and deployment strategies to support various deep learning neural networks, so as to help designers in developing optimization techniques and choosing reliability-friendly design options.

Major obstacles do, however, including human mistake, signal failures, infrastructure limits, and interrupted connection. Handling these problems requires a change toward smart, data-driven solutions as rail systems get ever more complicated. By means of data integration and analysis across numerous sources in real time, data fusion and actual time analytics have become necessary technologies to strengthen the robustness of rail signaling systems.That makes sense—that enhances situational awareness and decision-making—using sensor networks, IoT devices, and machine learning algorithms depends primarily on multi-source data integration. Trackside sensors, onboard systems, and outside environmental data combined enables rail operators maximize traffic management, discover anomalies, and project problems. Real-time analytics helps to increase safety measures by allowing proactive reactions to likely interruptions, therefore lowering delays. By improving predictive maintenance procedures, machine learning models enable to reduce unplanned downtime and increase the lifetime of important equipment. Among the predicted advantages of these developments are major gains in operating efficiency, safety, and maintenance techniques as well as early diagnosis of signaling issues, improved train movement, and reduced hand involvement that let rail systems run with more regularity. While real-time monitoring reduces risk associated with signal failures and track obstacles, enhanced predictive maintenance saves maintenance costs and increases asset use. These advantages are shown by means of a case study on the application of data-driven signaling upgrades in a goods rail system. Results define less signal failures, more precise train scheduling, and faster reaction times to operational disturbances.

Efficient Cyber Security Framework for IoT Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"Through the network's infrastructure, the IoT can impart perception, recognition, and remote control to inanimate objects. Due to IoT's characteristics, it's possible to integrate the real world into a digital system, which improves precision, productivity, and bottom line. While traditional internet infrastructure comprises of highly capable computers and servers, IoT gadgets have limited processing power and storage space. The authentication and key agreement system SecureAuthKey is very lightweight. The suggested technique is meant to solve the security and privacy problems that plague modern constraint-based CPS programmes. A lightweight approach for authenticating cyber-physical objects is one of the expected outcomes. Adaptation and autonomy in cyber-physical systems need not be compromised by a lack of trust or security in users' data or the devices themselves, according to a new type of security algorithm. To provide flexibility and scalability, a new middleware module has been developed on the Raspberry platform to facilitate communication between CPS-based devices and services. Secure Internet of Things (IoT) evaluation methodology that may be used in a variety of contexts and is user-focused. With the suggested system, the two CPS units will be able to authenticate one another. When a network grows larger, the possibility of an attack rises. Therefore, the IoT network is much more susceptible to attacks than conventional networks. As the number of connected devices grows, so do the number of potential threats to their security. To protect the IoT ecosystem from current threats, cutting-edge technology is essential. The proposed approach must be very efficient and have low computational overheads.

Towards Secure Industrial IoT: Blockchain System With Credit-Based Consensus Mechanism,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays an indispensable role for Industry 4.0, where people are committed to implement a general, scalable, and secure IIoT system to be adopted across various industries. However, existing IIoT systems are vulnerable to single point of failure and malicious attacks, which cannot provide stable services. Due to the resilience and security promise of blockchain, the idea of combining blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) gains considerable interest. However, blockchains are power-intensive and low-throughput, which are not suitable for power-constrained IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, we present a blockchain system with credit-based consensus mechanism for IIoT. We propose a credit-based proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism for IoT devices, which can guarantee system security and transaction efficiency simultaneously. In order to protect sensitive data confidentiality, we design a data authority management method to regulate the access to sensor data. In addition, our system is built based on directed acyclic graph -structured blockchains, which is more efficient than the Satoshi-style blockchain in performance.

Design Space Exploration for Secure IoT Devices and Cyber-Physical Systems,"With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), embedded devices have been gaining importance in our daily lives, as well as industrial processes. Independent of their usage, be it within an IoT system or a CPS, embedded devices are always an attractive target for security attacks, mainly due to their continuous network availability and the importance of the data they handle. Thus, the design of such systems requires a thorough consideration of the various security constraints they are liable to. Introducing these security constraints, next to other requirements, such as power consumption, and performance increases the number of design choices a system designer must consider. As the various constraints are often conflicting with each other, designers face the complex task of balancing them. System designers facilitate Design Space Exploration (DSE) tools to support a system designer in this job. However, available DSE tools only offer a limited way of considering security constraints during the design process. In this article, we introduce a novel DSE framework, which allows the consideration of security constraints, in the form of attack scenarios, and attack mitigations in the form of security tasks. Based on the descriptions of the system’s functionality and architecture, possible attacks, and known mitigation techniques, the framework finds the optimal design for a secure IoT device or CPS.

Development and Implementation of an IoT-Based Early Flood Detection and Monitoring System Utilizing Time Series Forecasting for Real-Time Alerts in Resource-Constrained Environments,"Flooding is a recurrent natural catastrophe in Malaysia, demanding excellent early warning and monitoring systems to reduce the impact on those affected. Traditional flood monitoring systems have severe limitations, including reliance on human data gathering, a lack of real-time capabilities, expensive prices, and slow response times, particularly in developing countries. To solve these issues, this research aims to design an Early Flood Detection and Monitoring System that uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology to provide a cost-effective, efficient, and real-time solution for detecting increasing water levels and sending early alerts.

A secure IoT and edge computing based EV selection model in V2G systems using ant colony optimization algorithm,"
Purpose
The fluctuations that occurred between the power requirements have shown a higher range of voltage regulations and frequency. The fluctuations are caused because of substantial changes in the energy dissipation. The operational efficiency has been reduced when the power grid is enabled with the help of electric vehicles (EVs) that were created by the power resources. The model showed an active load matching for regulating the power and there occurred a harmonic motion in energy. The main purpose of the proposed research is to handle the energy sources for stabilization which has increased the reliability and improved the power efficiency. This study or paper aims to elaborate the security and privacy challenges present in the vehicle 2 grid (V2G) network and their impact with grid resilience.


Design/methodology/approach
The smart framework is proposed which works based on Internet of Things and edge computations that managed to perform an effective V2G operation. Thus, an optimum model for scheduling the charge is designed on each EV to maximize the number of users and selecting the best EV using the proposed ant colony optimization (ACO). At the first, the constructive phase of ACO where the ants in the colony generate the feasible solutions. The constructive phase with local search generates an ACO algorithm that uses the heterogeneous colony of ants and finds effectively the best-known solutions widely to overcome the problem.


Findings
The results obtained by the existing in-circuit serial programming-plug-in electric vehicles model in terms of power usage ranged from 0.94 to 0.96 kWh which was lower when compared to the proposed ACO that showed power usage of 0.995 to 0.939 kWh, respectively, with time. The results showed that the energy aware routed with ACO provided feasible routing solutions for the source node that provided the sensor network at its lifetime and security at the time of authentication.

VibroFM: Towards Micro Foundation Models for Robust Multimodal IoT Sensing,"The paper argues for the feasibility and utility of micro foundation models (µFMs), a key direction for future smart IoT/CPS systems that exploits advances in self-supervised pretraining to support multiple downstream tasks. We demonstrate key beneficial properties such as latent representation independence from the downstream task, robustness to domain shifts, and ability to learn from unlabeled data. Importantly, we demonstrate the emergence of these properties after pretraining with only moderate amounts of unlabeled data, earning the name µFMs. To make the argument, evaluate model efficacy, and surface some of the underlying challenges, this paper describes a vibration-based µFM, called VibroFM, pretrained with moderate amounts of unlabeled acoustic and seismic sensing data, to support target classification and tracking applications. VibroFM is pretrained in an environment-agnostic fashion using unlabeled sensor data. It can then be fine-tuned to a given deployment using a small amount of in-situ labeled data. The paper shows that VibroFM (i) improves the robustness of several downstream tasks, (ii) efficiently adapts to different environmental conditions (using only small amounts of fine-tuning), and (iii) allows few-shot generalization to unseen targets. We further show that VibroFM can execute in real time on embedded sensor nodes. We compare the robustness and performance of VibroFM to conventional supervised deep neural networks, showing the advantages of the former. Combined with the feasibility of executing µFMs in resource-limited settings and the sufficiency of only moderate amounts of data for their pretraining, we conclude the importance of micro foundation models as a promising research direction for the IoT/CPS community.","Tomoyoshi Kimura, Jinyang Li, Tianshi Wang, Yizhuo Chen, Ruijie Wang, Denizhan Kara, Maggie B.

Fog-Assisted Dynamic IoT Device Access Management Using Attribute-Based Encryption,"The management and control of heterogeneous IoT devices in cyber-physical systems (CPS) involves ensuring authorized access to cloud-stored data, including instructions, commands, and configuration settings, and issuing them securely to IoT devices for remote execution. Existing access management techniques present various security challenges in ensuring fine-grained access control to sensitive data present on untrusted cloud servers. These challenges are further complicated by the need to dynamically evaluate contextual parameters linked to IoT devices before issuing instructions. This work proposes a secure and context-aware encryption technique for remote access control of IoT devices.

A Novel Hybrid Quantum-Crypto Standard to Enhance Security and Resilience in 6G-Enabled IoT Networks,"One of the most significant threats that hinder the effective functioning of existing models and technologies in 6G networks, particularly within the realms of Industry 5.0, is the lack of privacy and security. Traditional cryptographic models that were once considered secure have proven to be vulnerable to an expanding range of threats, such as quantum attacks. This vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized breaches and compromises the integrity and overall functionality of the network. Access control mechanisms implemented up to this point could not ensure that security compromises are prevented as secure data sharing is facilitated effortlessly. As a result, attempts to access sensitive data without authorization are often made, leaving the networks vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that have the potential to disrupt their operation. Considering these pervasive challenges, our article proposes an innovative hybrid protocol suite explicitly designed for 6G networks in Industry 5.0. Specifically, our approach integrates leading-edge technologies, such as nth-degree truncated polynomial ring unit encryption with supersingular isogeny Diffie–Hellman (NTRUEncrypt-SIDH) and key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE). It aims to address the vulnerabilities associated with traditional cryptographic models to ensure high confidentiality and authorized data sharing. Moreover, we implement modern DDoS mitigation techniques, such as rate limiting, traffic filtering, and adaptive routing, to enhance the resilience of the network and ensure that system operation remains uninterrupted. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over existing standards. Notably, the hybrid protocol achieves encryption and decryption times of 1.8 s and 1.667 s per gigabyte (GB), respectively, with a key generation time of 2.857 s per GB, ensuring efficient performance even in resource-constrained environments. The system achieves a total computational overhead of 11.7 ms for KP-ABE combined with NTRUEncrypt-SIDH, outperforming other cryptographic combinations. In addition, the model exhibits enhanced scalability, flexibility, and security, offering robust defenses against quantum and classical threats while ensuring seamless user policy-based access control.

Revenue-Optimal Contract Design for Content Providers in IoT-Edge Caching,"Edge caching is crucial in the Internet of Things (IoT) by accelerating content delivery and reducing latency, offering significant advantages. However, inappropriate incentive mechanisms may prevent third-party edge caching nodes from caching data. To address the incentive challenges in edge caching, this article proposes a contract theory approach to resolve the incentive issues between content providers (CPs) (Google and Microsoft) and edge caching nodes. Initially, utilizing the framework of contract theory, the security service quality of edge caching nodes is classified into a finite number of types, and transactions between CPs and edge caching nodes are modeled. Subsequently, contract packages containing popular data content and corresponding rewards are designed for different types of edge caching nodes. Utilizing the revelation principle of contract theory addresses the problem of incomplete information in the system, enabling CPs to maximize revenue. A blockchain-based reputation mechanism is employed to identify abnormal nodes within edge caching nodes. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared to other mechanisms, our proposed contracts can effectively incentivize the participation of edge caching nodes, significantly enhance CPs’ revenue, and improve content delivery efficiency and effectiveness.","Hongtao Li, Ying Chen, Yaozong Yang, Jiwei Huang",2024.0,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2024.3385446,Semantic Scholar,2.0

CPS-Based Self-Adaptive Collaborative Control for Smart Production-Logistics Systems,"Discrete manufacturing systems are characterized by dynamics and uncertainty of operations and behavior due to exceptions in production-logistics synchronization. To deal with this problem, a self-adaptive collaborative control (SCC) mode is proposed for smart production-logistics systems to enhance the capability of intelligence, flexibility, and resilience.

Adaptive Control for Security and Resilience of Networked Cyber-Physical Systems: Where Are We?,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), a class of complex intelligent systems, are considered the backbone of Industry 4.0. They aim to achieve large-scale, networked control of dynamical systems and processes such as electricity and gas distribution networks and deliver pervasive information services by combining state-of-the-art computing, communication, and control technologies.

Throughput-Efficient Lagrange Coded Private Blockchain for Secured IoT Systems,"We develop a new Lagrange coded blockchain model for Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems based on Lagrange coded computing (LCC). In the model, a mining task assigned to a blockchain node (BN) is encoded with a specific encoding function. Thus, the final result, i.e., newly generated block or block verification result, can be decoded even when only some mining outputs returned by BNs are correct, while other outputs are erroneous or discarded due to delays. To be decoded correctly, the number of mining outputs returned prior to decoding must be at least a given decoding threshold. Then, security against malicious BNs and resilience against stragglers can be guaranteed if the number of mining tasks allocated to BNs is not less than the sum of decoding threshold, number of stragglers, and double of the number of malicious BNs. Unlike other IoT blockchains and LCC-based methods showing enhanced throughput but yielding poor security, our model can improve throughput without compromising on security. This is achieved through optimized load allocations when the higher loads (two or more mining tasks) are allocated to the fastest BNs leading to: 1) increased number of mining outputs returned prior to decoding required to meet the decoding threshold and 2) increased number of allocated mining tasks to strengthen security and resilience. To overcome the limitation of our model related to higher loads and, hence, higher mining costs to BNs, we develop a contract-theoretic mechanism that incentivizes each BN to complete its mining task through joint load and transaction fee allocations.","Alia Asheralieva, D.

Cyber-Resilience Evaluation of Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) use computational resources to control physical processes and provide critical services. For this reason, an attack in these systems may have dangerous consequences in the physical world. Hence, cyber- resilience is a fundamental property to ensure the safety of the people, the environment and the controlled physical processes. In this paper, we present metrics to quantify the cyber-resilience level based on the design, structure, stability, and performance under the attack of a given CPS. The metrics provide reference points to evaluate whether the system is better prepared or not to face the adversaries. This way, it is possible to quantify the ability to recover from an adversary using its mathematical model based on actuators saturation. Finally, we validate our approach using a numeric simulation on the Tennessee Eastman control challenge problem.","M. Segovia, José Rubio-Hernán, A.

"The Internet of Things (IoT): a survey of techniques, operating systems, and trends","
Purpose
Internet has changed radically in the way people interact in the virtual world, in their careers or social relationships. IoT technology has added a new vision to this process by enabling connections between smart objects and humans, and also between smart objects themselves, which leads to anything, anytime, anywhere, and any media communications. IoT allows objects to physically see, hear, think, and perform tasks by making them talk to each other, share information and coordinate decisions. To enable the vision of IoT, it utilizes technologies such as ubiquitous computing, context awareness, RFID, WSN, embedded devices, CPS, communication technologies, and internet protocols. IoT is considered to be the future internet, which is significantly different from the Internet we use today. The purpose of this paper is to provide up-to-date literature on trends of IoT research which is driven by the need for convergence of several interdisciplinary technologies and new applications.


Design/methodology/approach
A comprehensive IoT literature review has been performed in this paper as a survey. The survey starts by providing an overview of IoT concepts, visions and evolutions. IoT architectures are also explored. Then, the most important components of IoT are discussed including a thorough discussion of IoT operating systems such as Tiny OS, Contiki OS, FreeRTOS, and RIOT. A review of IoT applications is also presented in this paper and finally, IoT challenges that can be recently encountered by researchers are introduced.


Findings
Studies of IoT literature and projects show the disproportionate importance of technology in IoT projects, which are often driven by technological interventions rather than innovation in the business model. There are a number of serious concerns about the dangers of IoT growth, particularly in the areas of privacy and security; hence, industry and government began addressing these concerns. At the end, what makes IoT exciting is that we do not yet know the exact use cases which would have the ability to significantly influence our lives.

A physics‐based strategy for cyber resilience of CPS,"Naval forces rely heavily on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to conduct operations and achieve mission success. As CPS infrastructure becomes exposed to the contested world through networks, CPS security becomes much more important. In a CPS, the cyber components manage the physical components. ONR proposes that the overall goal for CPS resiliency is to have the physical systems behave properly regardless of fault and disruption. Our approach to CPS resiliency focuses on the physical components. We observed that the inertia of the physical components provides a natural but limited resilience, and is capable of tolerating short-term disruption without affecting the health and safety of the CPS. This and the fact that a CPS has a large difference between physical and cyber time scales, enables a unique approach to CPS resiliency. We present Byzantine Fault Tolerant++ (BFT++), a cyber resilient architecture that engineers the cyber components to be brittle against attack, which consequently forces cyber attacks and related disruptions to be short-lived and within tolerance of the physical system’s inertia.","Sukarno Mertoguno, Ryan Craven, Matthew S.

IoT-Enabled Adaptive Context-Aware and Playful Cyber-Physical System for Everyday Energy Savings,"Home energy savings via eco-feedback is often considered a serious, tedious, or even distracting task due to the need for frequent human intervention. In addition, most existing eco-feedback systems focus on providing energy usage information and ignore the users’ contexts. This may render the systems incapable of capturing the users’ changes when proenvironmental behaviors have been encouraged. To address this, our study leverages Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies to realize an adaptive, context-aware, and playful cyber-physical system (CPS) for everyday energy savings with the hope of facilitating collaboration between a person and a smart energy-saving (ES) system to the greatest extent possible. To leverage the benefits inherent in a CPS, bidirectionally interactive information visualization integrated with pet-raising gamification was incorporated into the adaptive CPS. This synchronized the information from the user's physical environment with its counterpart in the pet's virtual environment. In order to provide flexible services, all IoT devices were agentized to form reconfigurable agents. In our experimental evaluation, this bidirectional mapping empowered users to flexibly control remote appliances anywhere and anytime in a more natural way, which enabled users to embed interactions with the ES CPS into their daily routine. Furthermore, improvements to system adaptability (33% in precision; 21% in recall) along with the reconfigurable ES services (additionally saving energy about 16.21%) show the potential of the CPS to enhance the users’ experience and prolong the users' engagement in everyday energy savings.",Ching-Hu Lu,2018.0,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,10.1109/THMS.2018.2844119,Semantic Scholar,34.0

Safe Position Detection Based on Safety System-on-Chip (SSoC) for Wireless IoT Application,"Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are predestined for use in Industry 4.0 applications. However, the interaction between the virtual and physical world also creates risks that is essential to be controlled. In highly automated industrial systems, for example, robots are used in confined spaces together with working humans. The risk posed by such systems endangers, among others, the people working there. This paper presents an approach to ensure the safety of the situation described above, which makes the workspace of industrial robots safer by implementing a safe workspace detection system. This system comprises several detection sensors implemented in a 2oo3 safety architecture and a Safety System on a Chip (SSoC) based on a safe 1oo2 system architecture. The safety-related redundancy provided by the detection and calculation elements enables a safe position detection of the robotic arm in the 3-dimensional space. The presented system monitors the position of the robotic arm and thus supports the safety of the surrounding objects and the people working there by leading to a safe standstill or to a reduced speed of movement of the robot as soon as the defined and permitted working space is left.","J.

Design of a Secure Password-Based Authentication Scheme for M2M Networks in IoT Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems,"The Internet of Things (IoT) forms a foundation for cyber-physical systems. We propose an efficient and secure authentication scheme for machine-to-machine (M2M) networks in IoT enabled cyber-physical systems. Smart objects and smart devices over CPS are capable of capturing a variety of multimedia contents; interact with each other and also with the physical world in a fully automatic manner without human interference. The proposed scheme allows any pair of entities in an M2M network to mutually authenticate each other and agree on a session key for communicating data in a secure and efficient way. The authentication process does not incorporate the M2M service provider, and hence eliminates the burden of managing the authentication of massive scale devices at the edge of the network. The burden of the authentication process is offloaded and distributed on the gateways under the authority of this M2M service provider. The proposed scheme requires the mobile user to hold only one secret key provided by the M2M service provider, by which, he can roam randomly in the M2M network and authenticate to any of the gateways in the domain. Then, this authenticated gateway allows the mobile user to authenticate with any sensor node in the domain. In the proposed scheme, the authentication process does not rely on any public key cryptographic operations. Authentication is achieved using very few hash invocations and symmetric key encryptions. Therefore, the scheme is suitable for environmental sensors which are limited in resources (computation, storage, and energy). We analyze the security of the proposed scheme using BAN logic, which is widely accepted as a framework for the assessment of authentication protocols and also using ProVerif. We assess the efficiency of the proposed scheme and compare with some recently proposed schemes.","K. Renuka, S.

Cyber-Resilient Operation of IoT-Enabled Power Grid: A Nodal Local Energy Market Approach,"The decentralization of the energy grid, coupled with advanced communication technologies (LoRaWan, LTE -4G/5G- etc.), improves its operation and enhances its cyber-physical characteristics, thereby increasing the need for cyber resilience. This paper reviews the benefits of an IoT-based Local Energy Market (LEM), located at the grid's edge, suitable to capitalize on the reduced energy costs and increased flexibility offered by the heavy penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). LEM utilizes IoT-enabled devices such as DERs, Electric Vehicles (EVs), and smart meters to optimize energy services within user preferences and grid constraints. However, the increase in IoT devices introduces vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks, potentially compromising the LEM's operation and financial stability. We analyze the effects of cyber-risks through three attack scenarios involving False Data Injection on smart meters, Behind The Meter appliances, and photovoltaics, demonstrating possible outcomes like voltage violations and increased operational costs. To improve cyber-resilience, we propose a nodal Distribution Locational Marginal Pricing (DLMP) market architecture that addresses voltage and congestion issues and uses abnormal nodal prices as early attack indicators for swift intrusion detection. The IoT-based nodal market approach secures a robust local energy market structure, highlighting the essential role of cyber-security in modern power grids, and offers uninterrupted operations and enhanced resilience in decentralized energy systems.","Nikos Andriopoulos, Nikos Kanakaris, Alex Birbas, Alex Papalexopoulos, M.

Digital twins as run-time predictive models for the resilience of cyber-physical systems: a conceptual framework,"Digital twins (DT) are emerging as an extremely promising paradigm for run-time modelling and performability prediction of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in various domains. Although several different definitions and industrial applications of DT exist, ranging from purely visual three-dimensional models to predictive maintenance tools, in this paper, we focus on data-driven evaluation and prediction of critical dependability attributes such as safety. To that end, we introduce a conceptual framework based on autonomic systems to host DT run-time models based on a structured and systematic approach. We argue that the convergence between DT and self-adaptation is the key to building smarter, resilient and trustworthy CPS that can self-monitor, self-diagnose and—ultimately—self-heal.

Machine Learning-Enhanced Hybrid Source Location Privacy Protocol for Improved Security and Network Longevity in IoT Networks,"Efficient routing in IoT networks is critical for optimizing data transmission while addressing the inherent challenges of energy consumption, scalability, and resilience. Common routing techniques, such as flooding, tree-based, cluster-based, and geographic routing, each present unique advantages and limitations regarding energy efficiency, network congestion, and fault tolerance. In parallel, source location privacy protection (SLPP) has emerged as a pivotal concern in IoT applications like surveillance and environmental monitoring, where adversaries may exploit transmission patterns to identify sensitive source nodes. Despite advancements, current issues in SLP in IoT networks include balancing privacy with energy efficiency, ensuring scalability in dense network environments, and providing resilience against increasingly sophisticated adversarial models. Traditional SLP techniques, including phantom routing, random walks, and dummy packet generation, often impose trade-offs between privacy, energy consumption, and network longevity, limiting their practical application in large-scale IoT networks. Additionally, many existing protocols struggle with adapting to dynamic network topologies and fail to adequately address the challenges posed by hotspot formation, which can lead to uneven energy depletion and compromised privacy. Many SLP methods disrupt the Quality of Service (QoS) by introducing delays or reducing throughput, which can hinder the primary functions of IoT applications, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios. A new Hybrid Source Location Privacy (SLP) protocol that effectively integrates random walks, rumor routing, and Greedy Random Walks to obscure source node locations while optimizing energy consumption is implemented to overcome these limitations. The protocol employs a multi-layer grid framework, dynamic cluster head rotations, and phantom nodes to balance energy usage and reduce network hotspots. The new Hybrid SLP confuses adversaries by combining fake packet generation with adaptive routing strategies, enhancing privacy without compromising network performance. Simulations demonstrate that the Hybrid SLP protocol significantly outperforms existing techniques, achieving lower energy consumption, extended network lifetime, and robust privacy protections, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive IoT applications. The proposed Hybrid SLP protocol integrates a machine learning-based anomaly detection system to enhance its performance and security, highlighting the novelty of the proposed work. This novel combination of advanced routing strategies and machine learning strengthens network resilience against various threats.","Mrs. Neha Gharat, Dr. Lochan Jolly",2025.0,Journal of Information Systems Engineering & Management,10.52783/jisem.v10i9s.1250,Semantic Scholar,0.0
"Modernizing CPS with Blockchain: Applications, Challenges & Future Directions","The necessity for ameliorating management and secure process is imperiously required in this tech-driven world with the digitized working environment. The increased usage of the internet and the burgeoning connectivity through IoT have provided a significant opportunity for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to preponderate. These are advanced computerized devices that function together to perform specific tasks, respond to human stimuli, and control the physical segments. While this technology is already used in automatic pilot avionics, robotics systems, medical monitoring, industrial control systems, etc. yet the advancement of these systems must comprehend incontrovertible focus on making them efficient and secure. To improve the resilience, dependability, and security of these systems, researchers can incorporate Blockchain technology which has an inbuilt blend of consensual algorithms, secure protocols, and distributed data storage, with the CPS. Moreover, with the advancement of IoT in the upgraded version of CPS, such as autonomous driving, there’s a major need to manage big data with low latency and high accuracy. Therefore, deep learning can be applied for systematic analysis of big data, which supports vivid analytic ability.

IoT Security and Safety Testing Toolkits for Water Distribution Systems,"Due to the critical importance of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to the operations of cities and countries, research into the security of critical infrastructure has become increasingly relevant and necessary. As a component of both the research and application sides of smart city development, accurate and precise modeling, simulation, and verification are key parts of a robust design and development tools that provide critical assistance in the prevention, detection, and recovery from abnormal behavior in the sensors, controllers, and actuators which make up a modern ICS system. However, while these tools have potential, there is currently a need for helper-tools to assist with their setup and configuration, if they are to be utilized widely. Existing state-of-the-art tools are often technically complex and difficult to customize for any given IoT/ICS processes. This is a serious barrier to entry for most technicians, engineers, researchers, and smart city planners, while slowing down the critical aspects of safety and security verification. To remedy this issue, we take a case study of existing simulation toolkits within the field of water management and expand on existing tools and algorithms with simplistic automated retrieval functionality using a much more in-depth and usable customization interface to accelerate simulation scenario design and implementation, allowing for customization of the cyber-physical network infrastructure and cyber attack scenarios. We additionally provide a novel in-tool-assessment of network’s resilience according to graph theory path diversity. Further, we lay out a roadmap for future development and application of the proposed tool, including expansions on resiliency and potential vulnerability model checking, and discuss applications of our work to other fields relevant to the design and operation of smart cities.","S.

Reaching for Cardio-Metabolic Fitness and Resilience through Self-Healing and Guided Individualized Cyber-Therapy: An Opportunity to Reenergize Primary Care,"Background: There is a need to facilitate efforts to reduce metabolic, cardiovascular, and stressrelated risks with a healthy lifestyle and improve cardio metabolic and cardio-vegetative health and longevity with self-management and guided therapy. We recently introduced a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) to facilitate this process. CPS is a mobile technology integrating sensory data from various mobile devices into individualized dynamic mathematical models of physiological processes, allowing for analysis and prediction and maximizing user control and supported by the primary provider.
Methods: Closely mimicking HOMA-IR (a practical laboratory measurement of insulin resistance) is our metric allowing for the noninvasive observation of insulin resistance changes by estimating R or Rw-ratio which are defined as R=ΔL/ΔF and Rw=ΔW/ΔF where ΔL, ΔW and ΔF are lean mass, weight and fat mass change over 24 hrs. We can estimate R or Rw-ratio either with use of our Self-Adaptive Model of the Energy Metabolism (SAM-HEM) demanding precise calorie counting or with our Weight, Fat weight, Energy balance (WFE) model without mandatory calorie counting by serially measuring weight, fat weight, and energy balance. The verification of this concept was performed using data from 12 clinical studies with 39 clinical study arms and with total number of patients n=2010.
Results: The correlation between changes of HOMA-IR and changes of daily WFE calculated Rw-ratio was -0.6745 with a P value of 0.0000024.
Conclusion: Our cyber-physical system along with a sensor system can provide a truly individualized strategy for estimation, measurement, and prediction of physiological variables of the metabolism including changes of insulin resistance which are essential for prevention and treatment diabetes and cardiovascular disease in primary care.

Introduction to the Special Issue on Smart Systems for Industry 4.0 and IoT,"The development of big data applications is driving the dramatic growth of hybrid data, often in the form of complex sets of cross-media content including text, images, videos, audios, and time series. Tremendous volumes of these heterogeneous data are derived from multiple IoT sources and present new challenges for the design, development, and implementation of effective information systems and decision support frameworks tomeet heterogeneous computing requirements. Emerging technologies allow for the near real-time extraction and analysis of heterogeneous data to find meaningful information. Machine-learning algorithms allow computers to learn automatically, analyzing existing data to establish rules to predict outcomes of unknown data. However, traditional machine learning approaches do not meet the needs for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, calling for new technologies. Deep learning is a good example of emerging technologies that tackle the limitations of traditional machine learning through feature engineering, providing superior performance in highly complex applications. However, these technologies also raise new security and privacy concerns. Technology adoption and trust issues are of timely importance as well. Industrial operations are in themidst of rapid transformations, sometimes referred to as Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), or smart manufacturing. These transformations are bringing fundamental changes to factories and workplaces, making them safer and more efficient, flexible, and environmentally friendly. Machines are evolving to have increased autonomy, and new human-machine interfaces such as smart tools, augmented reality, and touchless interfaces are making interaction more natural. Machines are also becoming increasingly interconnected within individual factories as well as to the outside world through cloud computing, enabling many opportunities for operational efficiency and flexibility in manufacturing and maintenance. An increasing number of countries have put forth national advanced manufacturing development strategies, such as Germany’s Industry 4.0, the United States’ Industrial Internet and manufacturing system based on CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems), and China’s Internet Plus Manufacturing and Made in China 2025 initiatives. Smart Manufacturing aims to maximize transparency and access of all manufacturing process information across entire manufacturing supply chains and product lifecycles, with the Internet of Things (IoT) as a centerpiece to increase productivity and output value.

Controlling and Monitoring Greenhouse Gas Emissions using CPS and GHG Sensors,"We developed a greenhouse gas monitoring mechanism based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to mitigate global warming by controlling and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions have a significant impact on climate change and have negative effects on the environment and economy. Therefore, effectively controlling and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is an important task in the current global economic and environmental agenda. We investigated the use of CPS architecture and greenhouse gas sensors to regulate and record greenhouse gas emissions. The current measurement data from greenhouse gas sensors only provide concentration, which is not effective in correlating it with the potential impact of global warming. However, through the CPS, computer systems can consider parameters such as the molecular weight and atmospheric pressure of gases. Thus, we propose a conversion mechanism based on the composition of the two main greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane and their impact on global warming. We suggested that a database be used to continuously record the carbon emission impact over time to have greenhouse gas sensors using CPS architecture better assess emission problems and develop more effective control measures.","Shu-Han Liao, Shang Te Tsai, Wei-Liang Hsia",2023.0,"2023 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Electronic Communications, Internet of Things and Big Data (ICEIB)",10.1109/ICEIB57887.2023.10170177,Semantic Scholar,0.0

A Dependable Time Series Analytic Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems of IoT-based Smart Grid,"With the emergence of cyber-physical systems (CPS), we are now at the brink of next computing revolution. The Smart Grid (SG) built on top of IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the foundations of this CPS revolution, which involves a large number of smart objects connected by networks. The volume of time series of SG equipment is tremendous and the raw time series are very likely to contain missing values because of undependable network transferring. The problem of storing a tremendous volume of raw time series thereby providing a solid support for precise time series analytics now becomes tricky. In this article, we propose a dependable time series analytics (DTSA) framework for IoT-based SG. Our proposed DTSA framework is capable of providing a dependable data transforming from CPS to the target database with an extraction engine to preliminary refining raw data and further cleansing the data with a correction engine built on top of a sensor-network-regularization-based matrix factorization method. The experimental results reveal that our proposed DTSA framework is capable of effectively increasing the dependability of raw time series transforming between CPS and the target database system through the online lightweight extraction engine and the offline correction engine. Our proposed DTSA framework would be useful for other industrial big data practices.","Chang Wang, Yongxin Zhu, Weiwei Shi, Victor Chang, P.

Detection of False Command and Response Injection Attacks for Cyber Physical Systems Security and Resilience,"The operational cyber-physical system (CPS) state, safety and resource availability is impacted by the safety and security measures in place. This paper focused on i) command injection (CI) attack that alters the system behaviour through injection of false control and configuration commands into a control system and ii) response injection (RI) attacks that modifies the response from server to client, thereby providing false information about system state. In this project, we implemented deep learning (DL) multi-layered security model approach for securing industrial control system (ICS) against malicious CI and RI attacks. We validated this approach with two case studies: i) network transactions between a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) and a Master Control Unit (MTU) in-house SCADA gas pipeline control system and ii) a case study of command and response injection attacks. Based on this project result, we show that the proposed approach achieved a significant attacks detection capability of 96.50%. Also, demonstrated that performance of attack detection techniques applied can be influences by the nature of network transactions with respect to the domain of application. Hence, robustness and resilience of operational CPS state and performance are influenced by the safety and security measures in place which is specific to the CPS device in question.","H.

On the Security of Authenticated Key Agreement Scheme for Fog-driven IoT Healthcare System,"The convergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing is due to the practical necessity for providing broader services to extensive user in distinct environments. However, cloud computing has numerous constraints for applications that require high-mobility and high latency, notably in adversarial situations (e.g. battlefields). These limitations can be elevated to some extent, in a fog computing model because it covers the gap between remote data-center and edge device. Since, the fog nodes are usually installed in remote areas, therefore, they impose the design of fool proof safety solution for a fog-based setting. Thus, to ensure the security and privacy of fog-based environment, numerous schemes have been developed by researchers. In the recent past, Jia et al.

Still, there exist challenges in terms of (i) designing, deploying, and evaluating ML-based fingerprinting solutions able to detect malware attacks affecting real IoT spectrum sensors, (ii) analyzing the suitability of kernel events to create stable and precise fingerprints of spectrum sensors, and (iii) detecting recent malware samples affecting real IoT spectrum sensors of crowdsensing platforms. Thus, this work presents a detection framework that applies device behavioral fingerprinting and machine learning to detect anomalies and classify different botnets, rootkits, backdoors, ransomware and cryptojackers affecting real IoT spectrum sensors. Kernel events from CPU, memory, network, file system, scheduler, drivers, and random number generation have been analyzed, selected, and monitored to create device behavioral fingerprints. During testing, an IoT spectrum sensor of the ElectroSense platform has been infected with ten recent malware samples (two botnets, three rootkits, three backdoors, one ransomware, and one cryptojacker) to measure the detection performance of the framework in two different network configurations. Both supervised and semi-supervised approaches provided promising results when detecting and classifying malicious behaviors from the eight previous malware and seven normal behaviors. In particular, the framework obtained 0.88–0.90 true positive rate when detecting the previous malicious behaviors as unseen or zero-day attacks and 0.94–0.96 F 1-score when classifying them.","A.

Optimization of CPS Control for Double Deep Q Learning Based on Function Regularization,"Markov decision process (MDP) is a decision model based on probability theory and control theory, which is widely used in the field of automation control. Automatic generation control is a common MDP issue in the linked power grid. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm based on MDP, which can achieve dynamic optimization decision-making and online learning. The NERC's control performance standard(CPS) value may be employed as a reward signal to optimize the strategy since the automatic generation control(AGC) system is an uncertain stochastic system. Moreover, replacing Bellman error with function regularization may increase the AGC system's flexibility and resilience while successfully avoiding overfitting issues. Through simulation experiments, this paper proves that the double deep Q-learning algorithm with function regularization can significantly improve the CPS pass rate, and has practical application value.","Fuquan Huang, Jun Shi, Tian Mao, Shouquan Tang",2023.0,2023 IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power System Asia (I&CPS Asia),10.1109/ICPSAsia58343.2023.10294472,Semantic Scholar,0.0
Decentralized energy supply chain networks using blockchain and IoT,"The integration of Blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into decentralized energy supply chain networks offers transformative potential for enhancing efficiency, security, and transparency. This paper explores the application of Blockchain and IoT in creating decentralized, resilient, and transparent energy supply chains. Blockchain's ability to provide secure, immutable, and transparent transaction records, combined with IoT’s real-time data collection and monitoring capabilities, enables the creation of a more efficient energy distribution system. In decentralized energy systems, energy producers, consumers, and other stakeholders can interact directly, bypassing traditional intermediaries, which reduces costs and increases operational transparency. Blockchain technology facilitates peer-to-peer energy trading, ensuring secure and transparent transactions between producers and consumers. This reduces the reliance on centralized grid systems and fosters the growth of microgrids, allowing local communities to generate, store, and trade energy autonomously. IoT devices further enhance this by enabling real-time monitoring of energy generation, storage, consumption, and distribution, ensuring optimal resource management and reducing waste. Through sensors and connected devices, IoT enables energy networks to operate with greater precision, responding in real-time to fluctuations in supply and demand. The combination of Blockchain and IoT also ensures the security of decentralized networks by preventing unauthorized access and cyberattacks, providing a robust framework for energy transactions. Additionally, these technologies support greater traceability and accountability, facilitating compliance with regulatory standards and sustainability goals. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges of implementing Blockchain and IoT in decentralized energy supply chains, including issues of scalability, integration, and regulatory hurdles. Moreover, it examines the future potential of these technologies in revolutionizing energy systems by promoting sustainability, reducing costs, and enhancing supply chain resilience.

"RIS-IoT: Towards Resilient, Interoperable, Scalable IoT","With the introduction of ultra-low-power machine learning (TinyML), IoT devices are becoming smarter as they are driven by ML models. However, any loss of communication at the device level can lead to a failure of the entire IoT system or misleading information trans-mission. Since there exist numerous heterogeneous devices within an IoT system, it is not feasible to centrally monitor all devices or explore system logs to determine communication loss.

CAROL: Confidence-Aware Resilience Model for Edge Federations,"In recent years, the deployment of large-scale Inter-net of Things (IoT) applications has given rise to edge federations that seamlessly interconnect and leverage resources from multiple edge service providers. The requirement of supporting both latency-sensitive and compute-intensive IoT tasks necessitates service resilience, especially for the broker nodes in typical broker-worker deployment designs. Existing fault-tolerance or resilience schemes often lack robustness and generalization capability in non-stationary workload settings. This is typically due to the expensive periodic fine-tuning of models required to adapt them in dynamic scenarios. To address this, we present a confidence aware resilience model, CAROL, that utilizes a memory-efficient generative neural network to predict the Quality of Service (QoS) for a future state and a confidence score for each prediction. Thus, whenever a broker fails, we quickly recover the system by executing a local-search over the broker-worker topology space and optimize future QoS. The confidence score enables us to keep track of the prediction performance and run parsimonious neural network fine-tuning to avoid excessive overheads, further improving the QoS of the system. Experiments on a Raspberry-Pi based edge testbed with IoT benchmark applications show that CAROL outperforms state-of-the-art resilience schemes by reducing the energy consumption, deadline violation rates and resilience overheads by up to 16, 17 and 36 percent, respectively.","Shreshth Tuli, G.

Resilience Regulation Strategy for Container Port Supply Chain under Disruptive Events,"There are many inevitable disruptive events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters and geopolitical conflicts, during the operation of the container port supply chain (CPSC). These events bring ship delays, port congestion and turnover inefficiency. In order to enhance the resilience of the CPSC, a modified two-stage CPSC system containing a container pretreatment system (CPS) and a container handling system (CHS) is built. A two-dimensional resilience index is designed to measure its affordability and recovery. An adaptive fuzzy double-feedback adjustment (AFDA) strategy is proposed to mitigate the disruptive effects and regulate its dynamicity. The AFDA strategy consists of the first-level fuzzy logic control system and the second-level adaptive fuzzy adjustment system.

How Should Enterprises Quantify and Analyze (Multi-Party) APT Cyber-Risk Exposure in their Industrial IoT Network?,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks (e.g., a smart grid industrial control system) are increasingly on the rise, especially in smart cities around the globe. They contribute to meeting the day-to-day needs (e.g., power, water, manufacturing, transportation) of the civilian society, alongside making societal businesses more efficient, productive, and profitable. However, it is also well known that IoT devices often operate on poorly configured security settings. This increases the chances of occurrence of (nation-sponsored) stealthy spread-based APT malware attacks in IIoT networks that might go undetected over a considerable period of time. Such attacks usually generate a negative first-party QoS impact with financial consequences for companies owning such IIoT network infrastructures. This impact spans (i.e., aggregates) space (i.e., the entire IIoT network or a sub-network) and time (i.e., duration of business disruption), and is a measure of significant interest to managers running their businesses atop such networks. It is of little use to network resilience boosting managers if they have to wait for a cyber-attack to happen to gauge this impact. Consequently, one of the questions that intrigues us is: can managers estimate this first-party impact prior to APT cyber-attack(s) causing financial damage to companies? In this paper, we propose the first computationally efficient and quantitative network theory framework to (a) characterize this first-party impact apriori as a statistical distribution over multiple attack configurations in a family of malware-driven APT cyber-attacks specifically launched on businesses running atop IIoT networks, (b) accurately compute the statistical moments (e.g., mean) of the resulting impact distribution, and (c) tightly bound the accuracy of worst-case risk estimate of such a distribution - captured through the tail of the distribution, using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) metric. In relation to (a) above, our methodology extends the seminal Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) cyber-risk quantification methodology that does not explicitly account for network interconnections among system-risk contributing variables. We validate the effectiveness of our theory using trace-driven Monte Carlo simulations based upon test-bed experiments conducted in the FIT IoT-Lab. We further illustrate quantitatively that even if spread-based APT cyber-attacks induce a statistically light-tailed first-party cyber-loss distribution on an IIoT networked enterprise in the worst case, the aggregate multi-party cyber-risk distribution incurred by the same enterprise in supply-chain ecosystems could be heavy-tailed. This will pose significant market scale-up challenges to cyber-security improving commercial cyber (re-)insurance businesses. We subsequently propose managerial action items to mitigate the first-party cyber-risk exposure emanating from any given IIoT driven enterprise.","Ranjan Pal, R.

Early-Stage Risk Prediction of Non-Communicable Disease Using Machine Learning in Health CPS,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) embed computation and communication capability into its core to regulate physical processes and seamlessly mediate between the cyber and the physical world for various control and monitoring tasks. Health CPS, a variant of CPS in the healthcare sector, acts as a health monitoring system to dynamically capture, process, and analyze health sensor data through integrated internet of things (IoT)-enabled cyber-physical processes. These systems can suitably support patients suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or who are at risk of suffering from those. Identifying the risk of NCDs, such as heart disease and diabetes, requires artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the core of health CPS. Recently, there has been growing interest to incorporate machine learning into CPS, which can facilitate the disease classification, detection, monitoring, and prediction of several NCDs. However, there is a shortage of visible work that focus on early-stage risk prediction of these diseases. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based health CPS framework that addresses the challenge of effectively processing the wearable IoT sensor data for early risk prediction of diabetes as an example of NCDs. In the experiment, a verified diabetic dataset has been used for training, while the testing has been performed on an artificially generated data collection from sensors.

A New Perspective for Computational Social Systems: Fuzzy Modeling and Reasoning for Social Computing in CPSS,"The evolution of modern mobile terminals, social networks, and other intelligent services makes everyone become a ubiquitous information perceiver, producer, and propagator. Also known as “social sensor” and “social IoT,” these individuals and communities generate a huge volume of social signals, which has shown prominent value for mining. These unstructured social signals provide a new perspective in the research of complex systems, which makes the traditional cyber–physical system (CPS)-oriented information computing sublimate to the cyber–physical–social system (CPSS)-oriented knowledge computing. However, there still exist great uncertainties, ambiguities, and complexities in modeling behaviors of social individuals or groups. Especially when we apply big-data-driven learning-based models in specific fields and scenarios, the lack of domain expert knowledge and characteristics of system uncertainty severely limits the performance and accuracy of these models. The introduction of fuzzy system modeling integrates data and knowledge in the social computing area, which has shown its unique advantages in solving the above issues and has drawn more attention to this topic.

Cyber-Integrated Predictive Framework for Gynecological Cancer Detection: Leveraging Machine Learning on Numerical Data amidst Cyber-Physical Attack Resilience,": The growing intersection of gynecological cancer diagnosis and cybersecurity vulnerabilities in health-care necessitates integrated solutions that address both diagnostic accuracy and data protection. With increasing reliance on IoT-enabled medical devices, digital twins, and interconnected healthcare systems, the risk of cyber-physical attacks has escalated significantly. Traditional approaches to machine learning (ML)–based diagnosis often lack real-time threat adaptability and privacy preservation, while cybersecurity frameworks fall short in maintaining clinical relevance. This study introduces HealthSecureNet, a novel Cyber-Integrated Predictive Framework designed to detect gynecological cancer and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real time simultaneously. The proposed model employs a three-tier ML architecture incorporating Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for accurate cancer classification, combined with an adaptive anomaly detection layer leveraging Mahalanobis Distance and severity scoring for threat prioritization. To enhance resilience, the framework integrates Zero Trust principles and Federated Learning (FL), enabling secure, decentralized model training while preserving patient privacy and meeting compliance with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations). Experimental evaluation using a real-world healthcare cybersecurity dataset demonstrated high accuracy (95.2%), precision (94.3%), recall (91.7%), and AUC-ROC (Area Under the Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristic) (0.94), with a low false positive rate (3.6%). HealthSecureNet outperforms traditional models such as SVM, Random Forest (RF), and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) in both anomaly detection and severity classification accuracy. Its adaptive thresholding and response prioritization mechanisms make it suitable for dynamic healthcare environments, enabling early cancer detection and proactive cyber threat mitigation without compromising performance or regulatory standards.

Multiple time series database on microservice architecture for IoT-based sleep monitoring system,"Monitoring health status requires collecting a large amount of data from the human body. The sensor can be used to collect data from the human body. The sensor transmits data for almost every second across the internet. The challenge of the health monitoring system is the massive amount of incoming data. Therefore, a system capable of sending, storing, analyzing, and visualizing vast amounts of data is required for health monitoring.

Smart Health Records Sharing Scheme based on Partially Policy-Hidden CP-ABE with Leakage Resilience,"With the rapid innovation of cloud computing technologies, which has enhanced the application of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart health (s-health) is expected to enhance the quality of the healthcare system. However, s-health records (SHRs) outsourcing, storage, and sharing via a cloud server must be protected and users attribute privacy issues from the public domain. Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is the cryptographic primitive which is promising to provide fine-grained access control in the cloud environment. However, the direct application of traditional CP-ABE has brought a lot of security issues like attributes' privacy violations and vulnerability in the future by potential powerful attackers like side-channel and cold-bot attacks. To solve these problems, a lot of CP-ABE schemes have been proposed but none of them concurrently support partially policy-hidden and leakage resilience. Hence, we propose a new Smart Health Records Sharing Scheme that will be based on Partially Policy-Hidden CP-ABE with Leakage Resilience which is resilient to bound leakage from each of many secret keys per user, as well as many master keys, and ensure attribute privacy. Our scheme hides attribute values of users in both secret key and ciphertext which contain sensitive information in the cloud environment and are fully secure in the standard model under the static assumptions.","Acheampong Edward Mensah, Shijie Zhou, Yongjian Liao, Emmanuel Antwi-Boasiako, I.

Model-based Design Tool for Cyber-physical Power Systems using SystemC-AMS,"Cyber-physical power systems, such as grids, integrate computational and communication components with physical systems to introduce novel functions and improve resilience and fault tolerance. These systems employ computational components and real-time controllers to meet power demands. Microgrids, comprising interconnected components, energy resources within defined electrical boundaries, computational elements, and controllers, offer a solution for integrating renewable energy sources and ensuring resilience in electricity demand. Simulating these cyber-physical systems (CPS) is vital for grid design, as it facilitates the modeling and control of both continuous physical processes and discrete-time power converters and controllers. This paper presents a model-based design tool for simulating cyber-physical power systems, including microgrids, using SystemC-AMS. The adoption of SystemC-AMS enables physical modeling with both native components from the SystemC-AMS library and user-defined computational elements. We observe that SystemC-AMS can accurately produce the electromagnetic transient responses essential for analyzing grid stability. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SystemC-AMS through use cases that simulate grid-following inverters. Comparing the SystemC-AMS implementation to one in Simulink reveals that SystemC-AMS offers a more rapid simulation. A design tool like this could support microgrid designers in making informed decisions about the selection of microgrid components prior to installation and deployment.","Rahul Bhadani, Satyaki Banik, H.

A Computational Framework for Control Co-Design of Resilient Cyber–Physical Systems With Applications to Microgrids,"Critical infrastructure networks, such as power and transportation networks, are often modeled as Cyber–Physical systems (CPSs). With ever increasing complexity of these systems, there is a need for newer and more relevant metrics and design tools that will co-optimize the physical system components and control policies to guarantee resilience against cyber and natural threats. To this end, we develop a simulation-based control co-design computational framework that will concurrently determine the system and control parameters of a CPS to meet prespecified resilience, operational, and economic objectives.

Automatic Generation of Hierarchical Contracts for Resilience in Cyber-Physical Systems,"With the growing scale of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), it is challenging to maintain their stability under all operating conditions. How to reduce the downtime and locate the failures becomes a core issue in system design. In this paper, we employ a hierarchical contract-based resilience framework to guarantee the stability of CPS. In this framework, we use Assume Guarantee (A-G) contracts to monitor the non-functional properties of individual components (e.g., power and latency), and hierarchically compose such contracts to deduce information about faults at the system level. The hierarchical contracts enable rapid fault detection in large-scale CPS. However, due to the vast number of components in CPS, manually designing numerous contracts and the hierarchy becomes challenging. To address this issue, we propose a technique to automatically decompose a root contract into multiple lower-level contracts depending on I/O dependencies between components. We then formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to search the optimal parameters of each lower-level contract. This enables automatic contract refinement taking into consideration the communication overhead between components. Finally, we use a case study from the manufacturing domain to experimentally demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.","Zhiheng Xu, Daniel Jun Xian Ng, A.

"Securing Smart Cities: A Cybersecurity Perspective on Integrating IoT, AI, and Machine Learning for Digital Twin Creation","The burgeoning evolution of smart cities, characterized by the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), heralds a transformative era in urban management and citizen engagement. These technological advancements promise enhanced efficiency in city operations, improved public services, and a sustainable urban environment. However, the complexity and interconnectedness inherent in these systems introduce significant cybersecurity challenges, necessitating innovative approaches to safeguard the digital infrastructure of smart cities. This paper aims to explore the cybersecurity landscape of smart cities from the perspective of integrating IoT, AI, and ML for the creation of digital twins, offering a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and threats within this domain. Smart cities leverage IoT to connect various components of the urban infrastructure, including transportation systems, utilities, and public services, creating an integrated network of devices that communicate and share data. The incorporation of AI and ML into this framework facilitates intelligent decision-making, enabling the automation of services and the optimization of resources. This synergy enhances the quality of life for residents, promotes economic development, and supports sustainable environmental practices. However, the dependence on digital technologies also exposes smart cities to a range of cybersecurity risks, from data breaches and privacy violations to the disruption of critical infrastructure. The integration of IoT, AI, and ML in smart cities, while offering unprecedented opportunities for urban innovation, also amplifies the complexity of the cybersecurity landscape. IoT devices, often designed with minimal security features, become potential entry points for cyber attacks. The vast amount of data generated and processed by these devices, if compromised, could lead to significant privacy and security breaches. AI and ML models, for their part, are susceptible to manipulation and bias, which can undermine the integrity of decision-making processes. The interconnectivity of systems means that a breach in one sector could have cascading effects throughout the city's infrastructure. Against this backdrop, the paper investigates the role of digital twins in mitigating cybersecurity risks in smart cities. Digital twins, digital replicas of physical entities or systems, offer a powerful tool for simulating and analyzing smart city operations, including cybersecurity scenarios. By mirroring the city's infrastructure in a virtual environment, digital twins allow for the identification of vulnerabilities, the simulation of cyber attacks, and the evaluation of potential impacts. This proactive approach to cybersecurity enables city administrators to anticipate threats and implement protective measures before real-world systems are compromised. 
The research questions guiding this inquiry include: How can the integration of IoT, AI, and ML enhance the resilience of smart cities against cyber threats? What are the specific cybersecurity challenges presented by these technologies, and how can they be addressed?

Classification of System Failures in Cyber-Physical Systems Using Heterogeneous Edge Enhanced Graph Attention Networks,"From the past few years, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have rapidly evolved in various sectors by integrating computing, networking, and physical processes. CPS facilitates the management of critical infrastructure such as transportation, healthcare, and energy. Even though there are advanced technologies, which are vulnerable to failures led to severe consequences including unpredictable interactions between cyber and physical components. Therefore, to address these issues a robust model is proposed by using Heterogeneous Edge-Enhanced Graph Attention Network (HEE-GAT). Initially, the data is collected from BoT-IoT database which consists of huge traffic data. Then, the collected data is preprocessed using Z-score normalization is applied to standardize feature distributions while preserving network traffic characteristics. Furthermore, for selection of significant features Skill Optimization Algorithm (SOA) is utilized. Finally, HEE-GAT is utilized for effective classification of system failures in CPS. Unlike existing failure detection models such as LSTM-GNN hybrids, which struggle with capturing heterogeneous dependencies and dynamic edge relationships in CPS data, HEE-GAT enhances graph-based learning by assigning dynamic edge weights and utilizing attention mechanisms to distinguish between different failure types with higher accuracy. The proposed HEE-GAT model acquired accuracy of 95% when compared to the existing Fractional Artificial Protozoa Optimization enabled Spiking VGG-16 (FAPO Spiking VGG-16).","Saef Obidhusin, N. S.

Hybrid Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder for Efficient and Sustainable Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, particularly water distribution systems, have increased due to rapid digitalization and the integration of IoT devices and industrial control systems (ICS). These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution.

IoTEF: A Federated Edge-Cloud Architecture for Fault-Tolerant IoT Applications,"The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to an increased emphasis on edge computing for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), in which applications rely on processing data closer to the data sources, and sharing the results across heterogeneous clusters. This has simplified the data exchanges between IoT/CPS systems, the cloud, and the edge for managing low latency, minimal bandwidth, and fault-tolerant applications. Nonetheless, many of these applications administer data collection on the edge and offer data analytic and storage capabilities in the cloud. This raises the problem of separate software stacks between the edge and the cloud with no unified fault-tolerant management, hindering dynamic relocation of data processing. In such systems, the data must also be preserved from being corrupted or duplicated in the case of intermittent long-distance network connectivity issues, malicious harming of edge devices, or other hostile environments.

SMT-as-a-Service for Fog-Supported Cyber-Physical Systems,"Various properties related with the safe, correct, and efficient operation of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) can be expressed via formal languages and checked at runtime or offline by appropriate verification tools. Such tools operate on monitoring data about the CPS state and functionality, typically collected from IoT devices. A specific approach involves modeling CPS state or operations using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formalisms, and using solver software to check whether given CPS properties are satisfied or to derive satisfiable CPS configurations. The computational requirements of this process can however be significant, which challenges its timely execution on IoT/edge devices where input date originate. To address this challenge, we present an architecture that allows the distributed execution of SMT problem solving workloads over the computing continuum as a service. Our design supports arbitrary hierarchies of solver nodes running anywhere from the IoT device to the cloud, each independently executing decision-making logic as to whether to solve an SMT problem instance locally or to recursively offload the task to other nodes in the continuum. We demonstrate the benefits of offloading by implementing and quantitatively evaluating different reinforcement learning-based decision-making strategies addressing latency minimization and energy efficiency goals, and showcase the practicability of our scheme in a fog robotics proof-of-concept.","Stefan Holzer, P.

EC-MAP: A Lightweight Elliptic Curve-based Mutual Authentication Protocol for Secure IoT-Cloud Communication,"The rapid growth of smart home Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their reliance on cloud services for data management have heightened security risks, especially in authentication and secure communication. Current protocols often fail to balance the need for strong security with the resource limitations of IoT devices, leaving systems vulnerable to attacks like session hijacking, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle (MitM) breaches. To address this, we propose the Elliptic Curve-Based Mutual Authentication Protocol (EC-MAP), a lightweight solution tailored for resource-constrained IoT devices that require secure cloud interactions. EC-MAP combines elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)—using efficient 256-bit keys for robust security with low computational overhead—and hash-based message authentication (HMAC-SHA256) to enable mutual authentication, forward secrecy, and resistance to replay attacks. The protocol operates in three streamlined phases (initialization, handshake, and dynamic key renewal) and employs ephemeral keys and nonce-based challenges to minimize vulnerabilities. Evaluated through NS-3 simulations and formal verification with AVISPA, EC-MAP reduced authentication latency by 35% and energy consumption by 28% compared to Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and RSA-based approaches, while adhering to NIST IoT security standards. Results confirm its resilience against common attacks, scalability for large networks, and suitability for low-power devices. EC-MAP bridges longstanding vulnerabilities in IoT-cloud authentication, delivering a deployable, standards-aligned framework that strengthens end-to-end smart home security while maintaining operational efficiency.","Okwa, E.

Analyzing and Mitigating Attacks in IoT Smart Home Using a Threat Modeling Approach-Based STRIDE,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected devices that enables data exchange. It is widely used in areas such as healthcare, aviation, agriculture, energy, and home automation. Despite its rapid growth and the massive adoption of connected devices, IoT presents significant security risks. Traditional threat modeling approaches are insufficient to address these risks. Architecture-based modeling is recommended, as it considers the entire system and helps in understanding potential threats. Threat modeling is a systematic technique used to identify and evaluate potential threats that could compromise the security of a system.

ZIRCON: Zero-watermarking-based approach for data integrity and secure provenance in IoT networks,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is integrating the Internet and smart devices in almost every domain such as home automation, e-healthcare systems, vehicular networks, industrial control and military applications. In these sectors, sensory data, which is collected from multiple sources and managed through intermediate processing by multiple nodes, is used for decision-making processes. Ensuring data integrity and keeping track of data provenance is a core requirement in such a highly dynamic context, since data provenance is an important tool for the assurance of data trustworthiness. Dealing with such requirements is challenging due to the limited computational and energy resources in IoT networks. This requires addressing several challenges such as processing overhead, secure provenance, bandwidth consumption and storage efficiency. In this paper, we propose ZIRCON, a novel zero-watermarking approach to establish end-to-end data trustworthiness in an IoT network. In ZIRCON, provenance information is stored in a tamper-proof centralized network database through watermarks, generated at source node before transmission. We provide an extensive security analysis showing the resilience of our scheme against passive and active attacks.

"Measurement and Analysis of Hajime, a Peer-to-peer IoT Botnet","The Internet of Things (IoT) introduces an unprecedented diversity and ubiquity to networked computing. It also introduces new attack surfaces that are a boon to attackers. The recent Mirai botnet showed the potential and power of a collection of compromised IoT devices. A new botnet, known as Hajime, targets many of the same devices as Mirai, but differs considerably in its design and operation. Hajime uses a public peer-to-peer system as its command and control infrastructure, and regularly introduces new exploits, thereby increasing its resilience. We show that Hajime’s distributed design makes it a valuable tool for better understanding IoT botnets. For instance, Hajime cleanly separates its bots into different peer groups depending on their underlying hardware architecture. Through detailed measurement—active scanning of Hajime’s peer-to-peer infrastructure and passive, longitudinal collection of root DNS backscatter traffic—we show that Hajime can be used as a lens into how IoT botnets operate, what kinds of devices they compromise, and what countries are more (or less) susceptible. Our results show that there are more compromised IoT devices than previously reported; that these devices use an assortment of CPU architectures, the popularity of which varies widely by country; that churn is high among IoT devices; and that new exploits can quickly and drastically increase the size and power of IoT botnets.

Deep Neural Network Security Collaborative Filtering Scheme for Service Recommendation in Intelligent Cyber–Physical Systems,"Cyber–physical systems (CPSs) is a security real-time embedded system. CPS integrates the information sensed by the current physical sensors, through high-speed real-time transmission, and then carries out powerful information processing to effectively interact and integrate the physical and the information worlds. With the aim to improve the quality of service, optimize the existing physical space, and increase security, collaborative filtering algorithms have also been widely used in various recommendation models for Internet of Things (IoT) services. However, general collaborative filtering algorithms cannot capture complex interactive information in the sparse Mashup–Web service call matrix, which leads to lower recommendation performance. Based on the artificial intelligence technology, this study proposes a recommendation algorithm for a security collaborative filtering service that integrates content similarity. A security collaborative filtering module is used to capture the complex interaction information between Mashup and Web services. By applying the content similarity module to extract the semantic similarity information between the Mashup and Web services, the two modules are seamlessly integrated into a deep neural network to accurately and quickly predict the rating information of Mashup for the Web services. Real data set on the intelligent CPS is captured and then compared with mainstream service recommendation algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only efficiently completes the Web service recommendation task under the premise of sparse data but also shows better accuracy, effectivity, and privacy.

SRACARE: Secure Remote Attestation with Code Authentication and Resilience Engine,"Recent technological advancements have enabled proliferated use of small embedded and IoT devices for collecting, processing, and transferring the security-critical information and user data. This exponential use has acted as a catalyst in the recent growth of sophisticated attacks such as the replay, man-in-the-middle, and malicious code modification to slink, leak, tweak or exploit the security-critical information in malevolent activities. Therefore, secure communication and software state assurance (at run-time and boot-time) of the device has emerged as open security problems. Furthermore, these devices need to have an appropriate recovery mechanism to bring them back to the known-good operational state.

The Interoperability Challenge: Building a Model-Driven Digital Thread Platform for CPS,"With the heterogeneity of the industry 4.0 world, and more generally of the Cyberphysical Systems realm, the quest towards a platform approach to solve the interoperability problem is front and centre to any system and system-of-systems project. Traditional approaches cover individual aspects, like data exchange formats and published interfaces. They may adhere to some standard, however they hardly cover the production of the integration layer, which is implemented as bespoke glue code that is hard to produce and even harder to maintain. Therefore, the traditional integration approach often leads to poor code quality, further increasing the time and cost and reducing the agility, and a high reliance on the individual development skills. We are instead tackling the interoperability challenge by building a model driven/low-code Digital Thread platform that 1) systematizes the integration methodology, 2) provides methods and techniques for the individual integrations based on a layered Domain Specific Languages (DSL) approach, 3) through the DSLs it covers the integration space domain by domain, technology by technology, and is thus highly generalizable and reusable, 4) showcases a first collection of examples from the domains of robotics, IoT, data analytics, AI/ML and web applications, 5) brings cohesiveness to the aforementioned heterogeneous platform, and 6) is easier to understand and maintain, even by not specialized programmers.

Transformers-Based Multimodal Deep Learning for Real-Time Disaster Forecasting and Adaptive Climate Resilience Strategies,"Real time forecasting of disasters needs to be advanced and easy because with increasing disasters their frequency and severity. Traditional prediction can only be made with traditional disaster prediction methods: numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and remote sensing techniques, which are computationally inefficient, data sparse and cannot adapt to dynamic environmental changes. In order to overcome these limitations, this research presents a Transformer Based Multimodal Deep Learning Model to combine the existing multiple data sources ranging from satellite imagery, IoT sensor networks, meteorological observations etc., to meteorological and social media analytics. The model employs a multimodal fusion strategy, enabling dynamic feature selection and seamless integration of heterogeneous data streams. In contrast to the conventional deep learning techniques, such as CNNs and LSTMs, the transformer based model has excellent ability towards long-range dependency, reducing the latency of light inference and better computational efficiency. The results are proven to be 94% accurate, 91% precise and has 40% reduction in inferencer latency in real time, which makes it suitable for disaster forecasting. The advancement of the multimodal deep learning methodologies presents this research as one which serves to contribute to the AI driven disaster resilience. We will also work on future work in the form of advanced transformer variants, more data integration, and explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model interpretability and scalability. Finding have implications for the transformative potential of AI in climate adaptation and serve as a robust foundation for the next generation early warning systems and climate adaptation disaster risk mitigation across multiple sectors.","Srinivasa Rao Dhanikonda, Madhavi Pingili, P.

A DLT-based Trust Framework for IoT Ecosystems,"An IoT eco-system includes IoT network components, network services and network participants such as organizations, consumers, governments, and businesses. Due to its diversity and scale, trustworthiness is a critical concern to be considered during architectural design and the operational phase of these eco-systems. To do this, security, privacy, reliability, resilience and safety must be assured. However, existing solutions partially address these requirements using centralized approaches that come with challenges such as a single point of failure, scalability, and dependence on a third party. In this context, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and Smart Contracts, due to its intrinsic properties of transparency, immutability, and underlying secure-by-design architecture, allows distributed, decentralized, automated workflows, which can be incorporated to automate the management of the next generation IoT networks. In this paper, we propose a framework for IoT eco-systems providing seamless integration between IoT and DLT to create a decentralized trusted architecture, which ensures trustworthiness of IoT eco-systems at design time and a trust reputation model based on the architecture to protect it during the run-time. Furthermore, we have presented the initial steps towards the implementation of this framework.","Tharindu Ranathunga, Ramona Marfievici, Alan Mcgibney, S.

Multimodal Logistics for Resilient and Sustainable Global Supply Chains: Strategic Insights from Integrated Transport Systems,"Multimodal transportation has emerged as a critical solution for enhancing the efficiency and resilience of integrated logistics networks. This narrative review aims to synthesize current research on the effectiveness of multimodal logistics in addressing global supply chain challenges. Using a structured keyword-based search across Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, this study selected peer-reviewed literature published between 2010 and 2024. Emphasis was placed on studies focusing on cost optimization, environmental impact, digital integration, and strategic network planning. The review identifies five key dimensions—logistics cost-efficiency, crisis resilience, environmental sustainability, technological integration, and network design—as central to the performance of multimodal systems. Optimization models significantly reduce logistics costs and emissions, while real-time data and IoT systems enhance operational coordination. In crisis contexts, multimodal approaches offer adaptable responses, particularly when supported by digital infrastructure.

Byzantine Resilient Protocol for the IoT,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), often adhering to a single gateway architecture, constitute the communication backbone for many modern cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Consequently, fault-tolerance in CPS becomes a challenging task, especially when accounting for failures (potentially malicious) that incapacitate the gateway or disrupt the nodes-gateway communication, not to mention the energy, timeliness, and security constraints demanded by CPS domains. This paper aims at ameliorating the fault-tolerance of WSN-based CPS to increase system and data availability. To this end, we propose a replicated gateway architecture augmented with energy-efficient real-time Byzantine-resilient data communication protocols. At the sensors level, we introduce fault-tolerant trustful space-time protocol, a geographic routing protocol capable of delivering messages in an energy-efficient and timely manner to multiple gateways, even in the presence of voids caused by faulty and malicious sensor nodes. At the gateway level, we propose a multigateway synchronization protocol, which we call ByzCast, that delivers timely correct data to CPS applications, despite the failure or maliciousness of a number of gateways. We show, through extensive simulations, that our protocols provide better system robustness yielding an increased system and data availability while meeting CPS energy, timeliness, and security demands.","A.

Adaptive Intrusion Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems Using Reinforcement Learning-Based Autoencoders,"The increasing integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in critical infrastructure presents unique challenges for ensuring robust cybersecurity. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often struggle with the dynamic, complex nature of CPS environments, making adaptive solutions essential. This paper presents an Adaptive Intrusion Detection System (AIDS) that leverages Reinforcement Learning-Based Autoencoders (RL-AE) to detect and respond to cyber intrusions in CPS environments. The proposed model combines the power of autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly detection with reinforcement learning to continuously adapt and improve detection accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark CPS datasets demonstrate that the RL-AE-based IDS achieves a detection accuracy of 98.3%, a precision rate of 96.8%, and a recall rate of 97.5%, effectively minimizing false positives to 2.4%. The system also demonstrated rapid adaptability, with a convergence time of less than 50 iterations in response to new attack patterns. These results highlight the model's ability to enhance system resilience and promote secure and efficient CPS operations in industrial and critical infrastructure applications.

Technical-Report: Automating Recoverability Proofs for Cyber-Physical Systems with Runtime Assurance Architectures,"Cyber-physical systems (CPSes), such as autonomous vehicles, use sophisticated components like ML-based controllers. It is difficult to provide evidence about the safe functioning of such components. To overcome this problem, Runtime Assurance Architecture (RTA) solutions have been proposed. The \RAP's decision component evaluates the system's safety risk and whenever the risk is higher than acceptable the RTA switches to a safety mode that, for example, activates a controller with strong evidence for its safe functioning. In this way, RTAs increase CPS runtime safety and resilience by recovering the system from higher to lower risk levels. The goal of this paper is to automate recovery proofs of CPSes using RTAs. We first formalize the key verification problems, namely, the decision sampling-time adequacy problem and the time-bounded recoverability problem. We then demonstrate how to automatically generate proofs for the proposed verification problems using symbolic rewriting modulo SMT. Automation is enabled by integrating the rewriting logic tool (Maude), which generates sets of non-linear constraints, with an SMT-solver (Z3) to produce proofs","Vivek Nigam, C.

A Game-Theoretic Approach for Enhancing Security and Data Trustworthiness in IoT Applications,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)-based Internet of Things (IoT) are among the fast booming technologies that drastically contribute to different systems’ management and resilience data accessibility. Designing a robust IoT network imposes some challenges, such as data trustworthiness (DT) and power management. This article presents a repeated game model to enhance clustered WSNs-based IoT security and DT against the selective forwarding (SF) attack. Besides, the model is capable of detecting the hardware (HW) failure of the cluster members (CMs), preserving the network stability, and conserving the power consumption due to packet retransmission. The model relies on the TDMA protocol to facilitate the detection process and to avoid collision between the delivered packets at the cluster head (CH). The proposed model aims to keep packets transmitting, isotropic or nonisotropic transmission, from the CMs to the CH for maximizing the DT and aims to distinguish between the malicious CM and the one suffering from the HW failure. Accordingly, it can manage the consequently lost power due to the malicious attack effect or HW malfunction. The simulation results indicate the proposed mechanism improved performance with TDMA over six different environments against the SF attack that achieves the Pareto-optimal DT as compared to a noncooperative defense mechanism.","Mohamed S.

On Feasibility of Coordinated Time-Delay and False Data Injection Attacks on Cyber–Physical Systems,"With the widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are facing threats from cyberattacks due to the vulnerabilities exposed in IoT devices. In this article, we analyze the feasibility of a coordinated attack, named TD-FDIA, on CPS by the synchronizing the time-delay attack (TDA) and false data injection attack (FDIA). It seems that the coordinated attack is more powerful than either one. But the analysis of its stealthiness and effectiveness is challenging. In the context of the networked control system, we first propose a general formulation for the impact of TD-FDIA on the system’s stability. Then, we analyze whether the combination of TDA and FDIA can destabilize the system and remain stealthy or not with different setups when the controller is with and without an observer, and the communication protocol between the controller and actuator is UDP and TCP, respectively. The conditions required to make TD-FDIA stealthy are given in some cases. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of TDA, FDIA, and TD-FDIA on the system’s stability with three different CPS scenarios.","Zhenyong Zhang, Ruilong Deng, P.

               <jats:p>The term Industry 4.0 as well as Cyber Physical System has lately gained a lot of consideration among most of the researchers as well as manufacturers while bringing in possible improvement solutions for maintenance of advanced technologies. The term Cyber Physical System or CPS is defined as the addition of computational and physical procedures on the technology of Internet of Things. This prototype helps in ensuring the connectivity of devices and elements with the Internet based protocols which includes the Internet of Services. This pattern of connectivity also enables horizontal services of internal factory through the entire value chain. However, there are several challenges that are faced while maintain the theories and practices of the above protocols. This part of the paper aims at providing a better understanding of the challenges that are faced by these components. The challenges that are faced by CPS are hence described with the help of further researches and are thus summarized from the perspective of energy control, transmission, secure control as well as management control techniques including allocation of system resources and designing of software based models. The paper also reflects the challenges that are faced by IoT from the perspective of communication security, protection of data through sensors and algorithms based on cryptography. Finally the paper also describes the challenges of IoS that are developed through cloud aggregation technology, allowing cloud providers to interact and collaborate in the improvement of cloud security infrastructure including its energy efficiency and reliability.</jats:p>","Husham I.

System Software,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In order to cope with the complexity of applications of embedded systems, reuse of components is a key technique. As pointed out by Sangiovanni-Vincentelli (The context for platform-based design. IEEE Design and Test of Computers, 2002), software and hardware components must be reused in the platform-based design methosdology (see p. 296). These components comprise knowledge from earlier design efforts and constitute <jats:bold>intellectual property</jats:bold> (IP). Standard software components that can be reused include system software components such as embedded operating systems (OSs) and <jats:bold>middleware</jats:bold>. The last term denotes software that provides an intermediate layer between the OS and application software. This chapter starts with a description of general requirements for embedded operating systems. This includes real-time capabilities as well as adaptation techniques to provide just the required functionality. Mutually exclusive access to resources can result in priority inversion, which is a serious problem for real-time systems. Priority inversion can be circumvented with resource access protocols. We will present three such protocols: the priority inheritance, priority ceiling, and stack resource protocols. A separate section covers the ERIKA real-time system kernel. Furthermore, we will explain how Linux can be adapted to systems with tight resource constraints. Finally, we will provide pointers for additional reusable software components, like hardware abstraction layers (HALs), communication software, and real-time data bases. Our description of embedded operating systems and of middleware in this chapter is consistent with the overall design flow.</jats:p>",Peter Marwedel,2021.0,Embedded Systems,10.1007/978-3-030-60910-8_4,CrossRef,

Malware Cyber Threat Intelligence System for Internet of Things (IoT) Using Machine Learning,"<jats:p>Cyber Intelligence (CI) is a sophisticated security solution that uses machine learning models to protect networks against cyber-attack. Security concerns to IoT devices are exacerbated because of their inherent weaknesses in memory systems, physical and online interfaces, and network services. IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks because of the communication channels. That raises the risk of spoofing and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the entire system, which is a severe problem. Since the IoT ecosystem does not have encryption and access restrictions, cloud-based communications and data storage have become increasingly popular. An IoT-based Cyber Threat Intelligence System (IoT-CTIS) is designed in this article to detect malware and security threads using a machine learning algorithm. Because hackers are continuously attempting to get their hands on sensitive information, it is important that IoT devices have strong authentication measures in place. Multifactor authentication, digital certificates, and biometrics are just some of the methods that may be used to verify the identity of an Internet of Things device. All devices use Machine Learning (ML) assisted Logistic Regression (LR) techniques to address memory and Internet interface vulnerabilities. System integrity concerns, such as spoofing and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, must be minimized using the Random Forest (RF) Algorithm. Default passwords are often provided with IoT devices, and many users don’t bother to change them, making it simple for cybercriminals to get access. In other instances, people design insecure passwords that are easy to crack. The results of the experiments show that the method outperforms other similar strategies in terms of identification and wrong alarms. Checking your alarm system’s functionality both locally and in terms of its connection to the monitoring centre is why you do it. Make sure your alarm system is working properly by checking it on a regular basis. It is recommended that you do system tests at least once every three months. The experimental analysis of IoT-CTIS outperforms the method in terms of accuracy (90%), precision (90%), F-measure (88%), Re-call (90%), RMSE (15%), MSE (5%), TPR (89%), TNR (8%), FRP (89%), FNR (8%), Security (93%), MCC (92%).</jats:p>",Peng Xiao,,Journal of Cyber Security and Mobility,10.13052/jcsm2245-1439.1313,CrossRef,

5G ready optical fog‐assisted cyber‐physical system for IoT applications,"<jats:p>Cloud services supported by the cyber‐physical system (CPS) have been emerged as a proactive and efficient solution to facilitate the alliance of IoT devices. The CPS assimilates, analyses and shares the processed information among IoT applications. The traditional network infrastructure is not designed to support the increasing demand for high scalability and real‐time delivery with ultra‐low delay. The proposed system addresses these issues by utilising the optical resources as fog nodes and software‐defined networking in the 5G network. A scalable OpticalFog node is proposed that creates the cyberspace near the IoT devices, thus providing an ultra‐low delay, minimising the energy consumption. Moreover, for providing service assurance to the various CPS‐based applications, an algorithm is proposed to place the task in the software‐defined networking. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated through the simulation in iFogSim toolkit that is used to implement the OpticalFog node in the 5G environment. The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed system.</jats:p>","Kiran Deep Singh, Sandeep K.
