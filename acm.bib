abstract = {Systems of Systems (SoS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have many common characteristics. For example, their constituents are heterogeneous, often autonomous, and distributed. Moreover, both IoT systems and SoS achieve their intended goals by means of the dynamic collaboration and coordination among their constituents.In this paper, by using the notion of Emergent Configurations (ECs) as a means to engineer IoT systems, we show how ECs in the IoT can be regarded both as systems and SoS by exploiting two scenarios.},

abstract = {The urban environment is becoming increasingly more connected and complex. In the coming decades, we will be surrounded by billions of sensors, devices, and machines, the Internet of Things (IoT). As the world becomes more connected, we will become dependent on machines and simulation to make decisions on our behalf. When simulation systems use data from sensors, devices and machines (i.e., things) to make decisions, they need to learn how to trust that data, as well as the things they are interacting with. As embedded simulation becomes more commonplace in IoT and smart city applications, it is essential that decision makers are able to trust the simulation systems making decisions on their behalf. This paper looks at trust from an IoT perspective, describing a set of research projects conducted that span multiple dimensions of trust, and discusses whether these concepts of trust apply to simulation.},

The IoE network must integrate embedded devices, people, processes and data in order to provide relevant information for various application areas such as medical, industry, aerospace, agrobusiness, automation, education, among others. In this paper, we propose an acknowledged System of Systems (SoS) to integrate IoE ecosystems that operate into educational environments. This SoS implements a service-oriented architecture to provide services as interfaces between constituent systems (CS). A CS is mediated by a negotiator agent that can be requested by the SoS coordinator agent to identify the availability of specific resources demanded by other CS. This coordinator agent is responsible for recommending the CS with the best available resource for the requester CS and providing information about how access it. All the IoE components also may be mediated by intelligent agents thus increasing the robustness of an IoE ecosystem.},

abstract = {A systems-of-systems (SoS) is a class of systems characterized by the collaboration among independent constituent systems, each one with its own purposes and functionalities and interacting with the others aiming to meet common global missions. An essential characteristic of any SoS is the so-called emergent behavior, which stands for the ability of an SoS of providing new functionalities resulted from the runtime collaboration among the constituent systems and that are not performed by any of them in isolation. Despite the importance of this subject, it is possible to notice that there are some lacks related to understanding emergent behavior in SoS, how it manifests, and which challenges it imposes to the development of this class of systems. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed to elicit and analyze the state-of-the-art on emergent behavior in SoS. By following a systematic procedure of search and selection of primary studies, a set of 37 existing studies was analyzed with respect to contributions related to emergent behavior in SoS. Obtained results show that the studies do not deeply investigate emergent behavior even though they mention this characteristic. Grounded on such a discussion, this work also presents a research agenda with directions for further work on the topic.},

abstract = {Systems-of-Systems (SoS) are being widely embraced by both practitioners and researchers. They share properties such as distribution, evolutionary development (i.e., openness), operational and managerial independence, and emergent behavior. Those properties imply that any element (system) in an SoS is able to operate independently. Similarly, microservices are suggested as a system architecture with a strong emphasis on independence, as containers provide the required degree of isolation, and their infrastructure automation frameworks provide the means to deploy them as needed. In a microservices architecture, even data is independently managed; every service maintains its own datastore, and transaction-less interaction is emphasized. Our hypothesis in this work is that while the two approaches have been treated separately in the literature so far, they share many common characteristics, and it would be fruitful to investigate their synergies. In this paper, we analyze to what extent microservices architectures can be understood as a kind of system-of-systems, explaining some of the success of the microservices approach a consequence of their SoS properties. In addition, the best practices proposed for microservices can enable a conscious, controlled, and manageable introduction of SoS concepts into system architectures, if they are needed.},

To address this challenge, we motivate, design and implement UrbanCPS, a cyber-physical system with heterogeneous model integration, based on extremely-large multi-source infrastructures in a Chinese city Shenzhen, involving 42 thousand vehicles, 10 million residents, and 16 million smartcards. Based on temporal, spatial and contextual contexts, we formulate an optimization problem about how to optimally integrate models based on highly-diverse datasets, under three practical issues, i.e., heterogeneity of models, input data sparsity or unknown ground truth. We further propose a real-world application called Speedometer, inferring real-time traffic speeds in urban areas. The evaluation results show that compared to a state-of-the-art system, Speedometer increases the inference accuracy by 21% on average.},

abstract = {The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within homes raises many security and privacy concerns. Recent headlines highlight the lack of effective security mechanisms in IoT devices. Security threats in IoT arise not only from vulnerabilities in individual devices but also from the composition of devices in unanticipated ways and the ability of devices to interact through both cyber and physical channels. Existing approaches provide methods for monitoring cyber interactions between devices but fail to consider possible physical interactions. To overcome this challenge, it is essential that security assessments of IoT networks take a holistic view of the network and treat it as a "system of systems", in which security is defined, not solely by the individual systems, but also by the interactions and trust dependencies between systems.In this paper, we propose a way of modeling cyber and physical interactions between IoT devices of a given network. By verifying the cyber and physical interactions against user-defined policies, our model can identify unexpected chains of events that may be harmful. It can also be applied to determine the impact of the addition (or removal) of a device into an existing network with respect to dangerous device interactions.We demonstrate the viability of our approach by instantiating our model using Alloy, a language and tool for relational models. In our evaluation, we considered three realistic IoT use cases and demonstrate that our model is capable of identifying potentially dangerous device interactions. We also measure the performance of our approach with respect to the CPU runtime and memory consumption of the Alloy model finder, and show that it is acceptable for smart-home IoT networks.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) require seamless integration of physical and computation components through communication networks. They often contain sub-systems from different physical domains (e.g., electrical, mechanical, and electronic) that must coordinate over a communications network to achieve a joint function. Thus, network characteristics significantly affect CPS performance and must be accurately modeled and simulated. However, simulation efforts are often siloed into specific domains (e.g., manufacturing, transportation, and electric grid) due to the level of complexity required to simulate even one domain. Co-simulation standards such as the IEEE High Level Architecture (HLA) attempt to facilitate model sharing between domains through definition of common services such as time management on a shared message bus. However, a well-developed, integrated, and configurable network simulation component that can be readily deployed in CPS co-simulations is lacking due to both the network simulation complexity and customization needed for specific domains. This paper presents a novel approach to create a highly reusable and configurable network simulation for HLA co-simulations which includes a cyber-attack library for analyzing behavior of CPS under attack. This work could provide effective means to quickly develop cyber scenarios for analyzing CPS through networked co-simulations.},

A vast number of gadgets in the market have a smartphone-based companion-app, making monitoring a variety of devices an overwhelming task for users. We propose IoTHound, an automated method to identify and monitor IoT devices in smart-homes.Our novel prototype leverages capabilities in current commercial off-the-shelf equipment such as routers with multiple antennas that provide insight into the activity of IoT devices in smart homes. We exploit two critical characteristics of IoT networks: device traffic patterns rarely change since devices perform specific tasks, and physical signal properties such as received signal strength indicator (RSSI) are useful since devices can move in closed spaces.IoTHound works without any prior knowledge of the devices. It uses an unsupervised learning method to analyze properties of the network traffic to: (i) identify IoT device types based on extracted network data, and (ii) detect deviations from normal network behavior by monitoring over time.Our evaluation of IoTHound on three distinct datasets comprising Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Ethernet devices, indicate that: (i) IoTHound can characterize devices with over 95% accuracy, (ii) IoTHound successfully detects all anomalous behavior in our test scenarios, and (iii) IoTHound can leverage physical characteristics of course device location to enhance its monitoring capabilities.},

Smart city strategies advocate for external technology interventions to improve the efficiency and sustainability of UIS. Internet of Things (IoT) is a key enabler for such strategies that helps to gather data from various infrastructure components and optimize flow networks in UIS. Although beneficial, such interventions often give rise to ethical concerns, underscoring the need for appropriate governance measures. In this study, we adopt a CAS perspective to analyse the ethical concerns of a proposed smart city IoT platform in the cities of Karnataka, India. Based on our analysis, we present a framework to aid city authorities in formulating appropriate strategies to govern Smart City IoT interventions in general.},

Thus, this study aims to evaluate the quality of cyber-physical solutions developed from an MDD platform. For this purpose, we performed an quasi-experiment, comparing a well-stable cyber-physical solution with the same solution implemented in an MDD tool. To compare the solutions, we explored several characteristics of ISO/IEC 25010 standard using qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Standards have been critical, not only in networking and computer interfaces, but also at the operating system and systems software level. There are many examples, such as IEEE 802, POSIX, IETF, and W3C. There was always the question of the right time to standardize (not too early and not too late), and the time to complete a standardization project always seemed too long, but inevitable. However, the contemporary industry seems to be more dynamic and evolving than it has ever been, demanding more agile processes. Open source processes and software defined (networks, storage, data centers, etc.) offer alternatives to standards. In this article we attempt to envision the future role of standards, and how they will complement and enhance alternative choices toward the same goal. We first summarize traditional standards, then discuss alternatives and a couple of use cases, and conclude with some future directions and opportunities for standardization.},

In this work, we construct and examine a proof-of-concept prototype of such a system of systems, which consists of heterogeneous commercial off-the-shelf components, and utilises diverse communication protocols. We recognise the inherent need for lightweight security in this context, and address it by employing a low-cost state-of-the-art security solution. Our solution is based on a novel hardware and software co-engineering paradigm, utilising well-known software-based cryptographic algorithms, in order to maximise the security potential of the hardware security primitive (a Physical Unclonable Function) that is used as a security anchor. The performance of the proposed security solution is evaluated, proving its suitability even for real-time applications. Additionally, the Dolev-Yao attacker model is considered in order to assess the resilience of our solution towards attacks against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the examined system of systems. In this way, it is confirmed that the proposed solution is able to address the emerging security challenges of the oncoming era of systems of systems.},

abstract = {"Internet of Things" (IoT) and "Smart City" are widely recognized to address the complexity of modern city operation. Concentration of population, scarcity of resources and environmental concerns are the main challenges that face city operators, and make ordinary service provisioning less efficient. In city environment, IoT sensors can be sources of real-time data; and, IoT actuators can execute real-time actions in the physical domain. IoT systems range from domain-specific to cross-sectoral systems where valuable data/ information flow across interconnected complex systems. Yet, to integrate domain-specific IoT systems into the complete vision of Smart City, as a System of Systems (SoS), there is a need to address heterogeneity of data sources, diversity of application domains and the big number of stakeholders across different phases of lifecycle. This paper suggests Service Lifecycle Management (SLM) concepts and Lifecycle Modeling Language (LML) to analyze, plan, specify, design, build and maintain IoT-enabled Smart City Service Systems.},

abstract = {Dynamically forming networks of cyber-physical systems are becoming increasingly widespread in manufacturing, transportation, automotive, avionics and more domains. The emergence of future internet technology and the ambition for ever closer integration of different systems leads to highly collaborative cyber-physical systems. Such cyber-physical systems form networks to provide additional functions, behavior, and benefits the individual systems cannot provide on their own. As safety is a major concern of systems from these domains, there is a need to provide adequate support for safety analyses of these collaborative cyber-physical systems. This support must explicitly consider the dynamically formed networks of cyber-physical systems. This is a challenging task as the configurations of these cyber-physical system networks (i.e. the architecture of the super system the individual system joins) can differ enormously depending on the actual systems joining a cyber-physical system network. Furthermore, the configuration of the network heavily impacts the adaptations performed by the individual systems and thereby impacting the architecture not only of the system network but of all individual systems involved. As existing safety analysis techniques, however, are not meant for supporting such an array of potential system network configurations the individual system will have to be able to cope with at runtime, we propose automated support for safety analysis for these systems that considers the configuration of the system network. Initial evaluation results from the application to industrial case examples show that the proposed support can aid in the detection of safety defects.},

abstract = {Compound faults often occur in mechanical systems under complex and variable operating conditions, which can seriously affect the health level of mechanical systems, so it is crucial to study the decoupling diagnosis of compound faults. In addition, industrial big data can greatly boost the accuracy and reliability of fault diagnosis results. Therefore, based on data fusion and attention mechanism, we propose a new composite fault diagnosis method called decoupling Transformer with convolutional fusion (DTCF). First, we construct the input embedding sequence as the model input. Second, the multichannel sensor data are adaptively fused using a convolutional layer. Then, the encoder encodes the signal based on global self-attention, which is representation learning. Finally, the decoupler iteratively generates decoupled labels. Two compound fault datasets are used, including the gearbox dataset and the bearing dataset, experiments on which show that the proposed method has higher accuracy, better generalization ability on the smaller training dataset, and stronger robustness against noise than CNN-based or MLP-based models. In addition, the visual analysis of attention weights makes the model interpretable.},

abstract = {Climate change is one of the most significant challenges to every country's development, ravaging havoc on the lives of all people on this planet. Researchers have raised numerous research and studies of strategies for tracking climate change. The current climate change tracking method in Rwanda employs a weather station model, in which numerous fixed weather stations are installed throughout the country; however, due to its immobility, this process cannot cover the entire country. With the lack of advanced methodologies and technology, the process of climate change tracking has become extremely expensive and suffered inaccuracies due to a lack of proper knowledge of analyzing collected data, and the lack of specific accurate hardware. Throughout this research, with the use of the MQ-135 and DHT11 sensors, ESP8266 collects carbon dioxide gas and temperature/humidity respectively and other component include a push button for detecting the current season. ESP8266 is programmed to send data over MQTT protocol, which uses Wi-Fi capability to send data to MQTT Broker. Using the MQTT protocol's Publish/Subscribe criteria, node-red subscribes to the topics defined in the MQTT broker to obtain data, which is then sent to MongoDB for permanent storage and also fed into the machine learning model for climate change/warming prediction. Different algorithms are used to evaluate this model. As result, Random Forest classifier approves itself to be the best model in evaluating the built model. This study shows that the increase in carbon dioxide gas leads to the gradual increase in the environmental temperature. Finally, the prediction clarifies that if no measures are taken presently, the climate change in Rwanda's Industrial zone will be dominated by warming periods in the future.},

To address these challenges, we repurpose the Transformer model, celebrated for its profound contextual insights, to explore the underlying principles of indoor localization. Our microbenchmark results compellingly demonstrate the superiority of our approach, showing improvements of 30% to 70% across a diverse set of 50 scenarios compared to other state-of-the-art methods. In conclusion, we propose a specialized Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) variant, termed LocGPT, configured with 36 million parameters that are tailored to facilitate transfer learning. By fine-tuning this pre-trained model, we achieve near-par accuracy using merely half the conventional dataset, thereby heralding a pioneering stride in transfer learning within the indoor localization domain.},

abstract = {Context: the Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that provides an ecosystem for a fast-growing quantity of connected devices, also defined as cyber-physical devices. Problem: the creation of Internet of Things solutions is fairly complex, having to integrate and communicate between sensors, devices, and larger systems, presenting many technical challenges not present in the same magnitude as other paradigms. One of the most affected segments is the development of cyber-physical devices. Much of its development energy is spent on the connecting and efficacy of these devices, often overlooking the future impacts of the proposed solution, caused by a lack of software quality. SI Theory: this work was designed under the Design Theory, currently found in the Justify/Evaluate stage’s refinement process. Methodology: model-driven development (MDD), a software development methodology that allows the generation of software solutions through abstract models, which aims to facilitate development, bringing the abstract solution closer to the problem’s implementation. In this work, a custom MDD approach for cyber-physical devices is presented. Results: the proposed approach and tool were able to generate C++ source code for Arduino devices, the generated source code performed better than control when compared using OOP specific software metrics. Contributions: this study presents an MDD approach for cyber-physical devices, where the innovative models are based and coupled to the hardware specifications, being extensible and flexible.},

abstract = {A Distributed Intelligent System (DIS) encompasses a set of intelligent subsystems and components that collaborate to perform tasks and solve problems. Given the advancements of paradigms such as the Internet of Things, along with the advancements of technologies such as Machine Learning and Digital Twins, DISs are on the rise. These systems are increasingly integrating components that perform intelligent functions, and these intelligent functions are increasingly heterogeneous and varied. Moreover, there is no standardized framework to help researchers and practitioners adequately address DISs. As a result, the complexity, interoperability issues, and development time and costs of these systems are growing. However, Model-Driven Development (MDD) can help to address these challenges by providing a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for developing DISs. In this work, a DSL for the design, validation, generation, and deployment of DISs is proposed. Firstly, the proposed DSL captures in a metamodel the key and high-level abstract concepts of the distinct DISs documented in the literature. Then, it allows modeling of DISs conforming to this metamodel. Subsequently, the DSL enables formal validation of the modeled systems. Lastly, it allows the generation and deployment of all DISs into production. Therefore, the work undertaken in this communication provides a methodological, formal, and standardized approach to defining and developing DISs from a high level of abstraction. This work allows users to address DISs by facilitating agility, minimizing manual tasks, and reducing the number of defects introduced in their development. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed DSL, a real case study of an agricultural digital twin is presented.},

In this article we focus on Autonomous Passenger Ships (APS), which are being considered as a solution for passenger transport across urban waterways. The ambition of the authors has been to examine the safety and security implications of such a Cyber Physical System (CPS), particularly focusing on threats that endanger the passengers and the operational environment of the APS. Accordingly, the article presents a new risk assessment approach based on a Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) that is enriched with selected semantics and components of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, in order to utilize the encoded common knowledge and facilitate the expression of attacks. Then, the proposed approach is demonstrated through conducting a risk assessment for a communication architecture tailored to the requirements of APSs that were proposed in earlier work. Moreover, we propose a group of graph theory-based metrics for estimating the impact of the identified risks. The use of this method has resulted in the identification of risks and their corresponding countermeasures, in addition to identifying risks with limited existing mitigation mechanisms. The benefits of the proposed approach are the comprehensive, atomic, and descriptive nature of the identified threats, which reduce the need for expert judgment, and the granular impact estimation metrics that reduce the impact of bias. All these features are provided in a semi-automated approach to reduce the required effort and collectively are argued to enrich the design-level risk assessment processes with an updatable industry threat model standard, namely ATT&amp;CK.},

Since the model-based engineering concept has been used for an integral part of CPSs, i.e., embedded devices, these methodologies should be carefully assessed, whether they still can be applied to design the emerging CPSs and to which extent. Accordingly, we first identify the specific challenges of CPSs. We then benchmark the established model-based engineering concepts concerning the identified challenges. In order to address the identified critical deficiencies and weaknesses, we propose to adopt carefully selected methods and strategies from the cyber-space domain as well as approaches followed by science and industry. Consequently, we propose a tailored engineering framework for CPS design, which represents a blueprint for future CPS projects. Our blueprint combines the strengths of the analyzed methods and concepts from all three domains -- model-based, cyber-space engineering and currently available solutions or strategies.},

In this context, this survey article first proposes a mathematical modeling framework that is rich in expressivity to capture IoT characteristics from a global perspective. It also sets forward a set of fundamental challenges in sensing, decentralized computation, robustness, energy efficiency, and hardware security based on the proposed modeling framework.

Based on temporal, spatial, and contextual contexts, we formulate an optimization problem about how to optimally integrate models based on highly diverse datasets under three practical issues, that is, heterogeneity of models, input data sparsity, or unknown ground truth. We further propose a real-world application called Speedometer, inferring real-time traffic speeds in urban areas. The evaluation results show that, compared to a state-of-the-art system, Speedometer increases the inference accuracy by 29% on average.},

Those behaviors can be deliberately planned as a combination of the individual functionalities (herein named as features) provided by the constituents. Currently, SoS stakeholders heavily rely on the creativity of engineers to combine the features and draw the behaviors. The limitation of human perception in complex scenarios can lead to engineering sub-optimized SoS arrangements, offering global behaviors that are limited to the engineer’s abilities and prior experience, potentially causing waste of the resources, sub-optimal services and reducing quality.In that sense, the main contribution of this paper is introducing MacGyver Predictor, a deep learning-based mechanism for inferring/suggesting emergent behaviors that could be designed over a given set of constituents. An initial dataset was elaborated from a systematic mapping to feed the mechanism. We expect that our mechanism can extrapolate the human capabilities and glimpse global behaviors, hopefully revealing unpredicted behaviors that could be offered by the SoS and supporting engineers to architect SoS with (i) more diversified behaviors and (ii) enhanced SoS overall quality.},

abstract = {Efficiently balancing supply and demand in the electrical distribution grid is an important Smart Grid service. The development of applicable agent-based concepts for match-making energy generators with consumers is an active research field. Implementing Smart Grids as a system of Micro Grid systems, we propose an efficient decentralized optimization scheme, which avoids central components in order to increase dependability, robustness against communication failures, and denial-of-service attacks. The concept utilizes traditional peer-to-peer functionality in combination with locality-aware routing: Two explicit clusterings are evaluated and compared to the fully-meshed communication approach. We investigate the impact of node clustering on the optimality and locality of the distributed Smart Grid control algorithm and show that our approach significantly reduces the electrical losses in the examined power distribution grid compared to the centralized approach.},

abstract = {In the near future, it will be possible that every object on Earth can be identifiable and addressable. Such objects will be able to be monitored and monitor their physical environments, and of executing actions on such environments in benefit of human users. Moreover, these so-called smart objects will be endowed with wireless communication capabilities. By being uniquely addressed, wireless endowed and through the use of existing protocols and standardized formats, smart things can be integrated in the Internet and accessed as any other Web resource. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges as a paradigm in which smart things actively collaborate among them and with other physical and virtual objects available in the Web, providing value-added information and functionalities for users. The IoT paradigm has recently showed its potential of considerably impacting the daily lives of human beings mainly due to the use and interaction of physical devices in several domains, including complex systems composed of other systems. In this paper we discuss the IoT paradigm from the perspective of Systems-of-Systems and present EcoDiF, a IoT platform that integrates heterogeneous devices to provide real-time data control, visualization, processing, and storage. In EcoDiF, devices, information, users and applications are integrated to create an IoT ecosystem in which new ideas and products can be developed in an organic way.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a method for the static analysis of belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents integrated with cyber-physical systems (CPS) using Petri nets (PN) and Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques, especially for their communication. CPS integrates computational and physical elements that need verification to ensure correct and safe operations before deploying BDI agents. The BDI agents provide intelligent behaviour in CPS, while PN provides a framework for analyzing these behaviours. By simulating PN, the operation of BDI agents can be analysed statically before deployment on CPS. In this regard, MDE enables the transformation of the semantic space of BDI agents into PN. Due to the BDI model's high-level abstraction, high-level expressiveness, such as Colored Petri nets (CPN), is required to detect undesired execution paths within the agent or from another agent via messaging. This process applies the Jason BDI AgentSpeak codes translation into a CPN model. This mapping paves the way to verify reachability, boundedness, and deadlock properties. Additionally, a case study is presented to illustrate the method's applicability. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with multiple agents communicating via a specific messaging structure.},

abstract = {The rapid advancements in big data and the Internet of Things (IoT) have significantly accelerated the digital transformation of medical institutions, leading to the widespread adoption of Digital Twin Healthcare (DTH). The Cloud DTH Platform (CDTH) serves as a cloud-based framework that integrates DTH models, healthcare resources, patient data, and medical services. By leveraging real-time data from medical devices, the CDTH platform enables intelligent healthcare services such as disease prediction and medical resource optimization. However, the platform functions as a system of systems (SoS), comprising interconnected yet independent healthcare services. This complexity is further compounded by the integration of both black-box AI models and domain-specific mechanistic models, which pose challenges in ensuring the interpretability and trustworthiness of DTH models. To address these challenges, we propose a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)-driven DTH modeling methodology derived from systematic requirement and functional analyses. To implement this methodology effectively, we introduce a DTH model development approach using the X language, along with a comprehensive toolchain designed to streamline the development process. Together, this methodology and toolchain form a robust framework that enables engineers to efficiently develop interpretable and trustworthy DTH models for the CDTH platform. By integrating domain-specific mechanistic models with AI algorithms, the framework enhances model transparency and reliability. Finally, we validate our approach through a case study involving elderly patient care, demonstrating its effectiveness in supporting the development of DTH models that meet healthcare and interpretability requirements.},

abstract = {Owing1 to an immense growth of internet-connected and learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPSs) [1], several new types of attack vectors have emerged. Analyzing security and resilience of these complex CPSs is difficult as it requires evaluating many subsystems and factors in an integrated manner. Integrated simulation of physical systems and communication network can provide an underlying framework for creating a reusable and configurable testbed for such analyses. Using a model-based integration approach and the IEEE High-Level Architecture (HLA) [2] based distributed simulation software; we have created a testbed for integrated evaluation of large-scale CPS systems. Our tested supports web-based collaborative metamodeling and modeling of CPS system and experiments and a cloud computing environment for executing integrated networked co-simulations. A modular and extensible cyber-attack library enables validating the CPS under a variety of configurable cyber-attacks, such as DDoS and integrity attacks. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation is also supported along with several hardware attacks. Further, a scenario modeling language allows modeling of alternative paths (Courses of Actions) that enables validating CPS under different what-if scenarios as well as conducting cyber-gaming experiments. These capabilities make our testbed well suited for analyzing security and resilience of CPS. In addition, the web-based modeling and cloud-hosted execution infrastructure enables one to exercise the entire testbed using simply a web-browser, with integrated live experimental results display.},

Moreover, traditional validation approaches need to undergo significant transformation to be made applicable to digital twins. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a systematic treatment of validating digital twin models. This paper identifies several challenges facing the model validation within digital twins. Furthermore, we propose an initial framework to define basic rules of digital twin model validation and introduce a systematic approach to validation that seamlessly combines expert knowledge and data gathered from available Internet of Things (IoT) devices.},

SoS are composed of several independent systems and often support critical domains. As such, failures can cause serious damage or even financial losses that can be avoided by performing quality assurance (QA). Among QA techniques, software testing is an essential activity that checks software behaviors against a subset of parameters. However, testing SoS can be even more complex since several other factors further elevate the complexity of the test, such as interoperability links and multiple independent systems. Goal: Our goal in this paper is to analyze the current state of research on software testing for SoS domain. Method: A protocol was formulated and executed according to the guidelines for performing systematic literature mappings in Software Engineering. Results: This study identified the tools, approaches, methods and processes that the literature has addressed to test SoS. Conclusions: Software Testing for SoS still faces several problems and presents many questions to be answered, particularly in the definition of processes and metrics.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems are being increasingly employed in everyday applications, including critical ones. This integration of operational technology systems, originally designed to operate in physical isolation -hence with no or little cyber security defences- with information technology systems, by default meant to be networked, dramatically increases the cyber-attack surface of the resulting composite systems. Thus, the assessment of the security posture of cyber-physical systems, as well as the evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the defensive mechanisms become of paramount importance. Unfortunately, testing cyber security in live real-world cyber-physical systems is not advisable, even when it is possible; hence, the use of testbeds is a necessary alternative. This work surveys cyber-physical testbeds in five major application domains, with an eye towards identifying key features to be subsequently used as input to the process of defining requirements for future cyber-physical testbeds with cyber security posture assessment capability. We then propose a reference architecture for the next generation of cyber ranges, namely the cyber-physical ranges.},

abstract = {The last decade has seen an influx of digital connectivity, operation automation, and remote sensing and control mechanisms in the railway domain. The management of the railway operations through the use of distributed sensors and controllers and with programmable and remotely controllable railway signals and switches has led to gains in system efficiency as well as operational flexibility. However, the network connectivity has opened up the railway cyber communication networks to cyber-attacks. These are a class of cyber-physical systems (CPS) with interconnected physical, computational, and communication components. The cyber-attacks on these systems could potentially cascade through these inter-connection and result into significant damage. These systems are safety-critical owing to their large-scale monetary and, more importantly, human life safety concerns. Therefore, it is better to incorporate security and resilience requirements right from the design time. In this paper, we describe a domain-specific framework for simulations in the railway domain. The framework allows analyzing the resilience of railway operations in the presence of cyber-attacks. In particular, our simulation framework allows modeling the railway network as well as the railway transportation. It provides an online graphical modeling environment that allows multiple users to collaborate, through a web-based interface, over the same model for the railway infrastructure as well as network attacks. The framework also allows the user to configure and run experiments through the web-interface and also to visualize the key operational metrics from the railway domain as the experiment is running. The framework also supports executing large simulations in the cloud. In addition, it supports hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation for incorporating physical effects and network attacks that can only be realized realistically in the hardware. A detailed case study is provided to demonstrate the framework's capabilities.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and the new emerging IoT computing paradigm such as edge computing, it is prevalent to see that today’s real-time and functional safety devices, particularly in industrial IoT and automotive scenarios, are getting multi-functional by combining multiple platforms into single product. The new trend potentially prompts embedded virtualization as a promising solution in terms of workload consolidation, separation, and cost- effective. However, hypervisors, such as KVM and XEN, are designed to run on a server and can not be easily restructured to fulfill the requirements such as real-time constrains from IoT products. Meanwhile, existing embedded virtualization solutions are normally tailored towards specific IoT scenarios, which makes them hard to extend towards various scenarios. In addition, most commercial solutions are mature and appealing but expensive and closed-source. This paper presents ACRN, a flexible, lightweight, scalable, and open source embedded hypervisor for IoT development. By focusing on CPU and memory partitioning, and mean- while optionally offloading embedded I/O virtualization to a tiny user space device model, ACRN presents a consolidated system satisfying real-time and general-purpose needs simultaneously. By adopting customer-friendly permissive BSD license, ACRN provides a practical industry-grade solution with immediate readiness. In this paper we will de- scribe the design and implementation of ACRN, and conduct thorough evaluations to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness.

abstract = {Designing a Cyber-physical system (CPS) including modeling the control components and services is a challenging issue. Models and simulations at run-time play a crucial role to implement these control and prediction components.Real-time constraints raise the complexity of designing an efficient CPS system. Having detailed models in making decisions and/or numerous predictions in different contexts is computationally expensive and difficult to schedule on the computational infrastructure.Inspired by substitutability, one strategy for dealing with complex CPS and the contradiction of better real-time performance and reduced cost in CPS is to employ approximated models and switch to the most suited model adaptively at run-time.However, using an approximate model raises the uncertainty on the model's predictions. Nonetheless, the model is appropriate when the uncertainty is within bound. This bound is defined as tolerance which is the permitted amount of uncertainty.In this paper, we propose a method for quantifying the tolerance of cyber-physical systems, where we can switch between the original model and approximated models and how to identify more appropriate models.},

Wireless communication technologies have enabled a kaleidoscopic range of applications that are revolutionizing many aspects of business and public services.

abstract = {With the advent of Space-IoTs, the rate of launch of satellites has grown significantly. Alongside, the failure rate of satellites has also surged increased tremendously. Satellites are non-repairable systems in orbit, and the financial loss incurred when the satellites fail before their expected mission time is substantial. If the source of a failure is known while the satellite is in orbit, then there is a possibility to revive it by sending appropriate commands from ground stations. In this work, we present a simple, independent satellite health monitoring system called Chirper. The Chirper is equipped with multiple modules such as IMU, isolated voltage and current measurement probes, and an onboard communication channel. We present a new approach to measure low DC voltages in an isolated way, providing a resolution and accuracy of around 1 V. We evaluated the design and performance of the Chirper through simulation, testing it in space systems test facility, and by mounting it on a helium balloon. With extensive experiments we show that 90% of the time the dc voltage measurement error is within 0.8 V, and the maximum error is 0.9 V. We expect to launch the Chirper soon on a space system.},

abstract = {Digital Twins (DT) are software systems representing different aspects of a physical or conceptual counterpart---the real twin, which is instrumented with several sensors or computing devices that generate, consume and transfer data to its DT with different purposes. In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.},

abstract = {Many technological innovations from the research area of dynamic adaptive systems or IT ecosystems are already established in current software systems. Especially cyber-physical systems should benefit by this progress to provide smart applications in ambient environments of private and industrial space. But a proper and methodical engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems (CPES) is still an open and important issue. Traditional software and systems engineering facilities (system models, description languages, or process models) do not consider fundamental characteristics of these ecosystems as openness, uncertainty, or emergent constitution at runtime sufficiently. But especially these aspects let blur the line of system boundaries at design time. The diverse components of CPES have essential impacts on the engineering of CPES as well, concerning time synchronizing, execution control, and interaction structure. Self-balanced control in CPES promises new application possibilities, but also needs new engineering techniques concerning the overall engineering process, including requirements engineering and runtime verification. In this position paper we survey and summarize the dimensions of challenges in applying control theory for the engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems.},

abstract = {As new IT systems and devices pervade all aspects of human routines, several new paradigms have recognized groups of IT systems as forming an ecosystem. As a result, the term "IT ecosystem" has been coined. Each individual system participating in an IT ecosystem has, to a varying degree, autonomy. The ultimate goal of participating systems is to satisfy the global goal of the entire IT ecosystem in which they are participating. In order to maintain autonomy and controllability over an IT ecosystem through environmental changes, orchestration strategies must be invented and implemented. In this paper, we propose a reference orchestration architecture framework, which we call ITE Arbitrator, to support IT ecosystems in accomplishing the goals of individual participant systems while simultaneously achieving system-wide goals. ITE Arbitrator provides a mechanism to decide on an adaptation strategy with an optimal configuration of available systems to satisfy local constraints while achieving its global goal. We use the detailed simulation example of an unmanned forest management IT ecosystem to show how the proposed framework orchestrates inter-system interaction against environmental changes and sustains stable service.},

This leads to a new design space also for software development, allowing new allocation strategies for functionality. In traditional embedded systems, all functionality was inside the product, but now it becomes possible to partition the software between the embedded systems and IT systems outside the product. This paper investigates, through a case study from the automotive domain, possible new allocation alternatives where computation is offloaded from the embedded system to a server, and what additional architectural concerns this leads to, including performance, resource utilization, robustness, and lifecycle aspects. In addition, the paper addresses new opportunities created by allocating functionality outside the embedded systems, and thus making data available for extended services, as well as the larger concerns that result on the organizational level, including new competency in architecture and DevOps.},

abstract = {Wearable and energy efficient processing nodes, allowing for continuous remote monitoring of patient vital parameters, are mainstream in modern health-care practice. Most recent approaches to the development of such systems combine near-sensor data processing with cognitive computing, to improve at the same time communication efficiency, responsiveness and accuracy of the analysis of the sensed data. In this paper, we present a hardware-software architecture for a connected sensor-processing node that allows the set of in-place processing tasks to be executed to be remotely controllable by an external user. The designed system is capable of dynamically adapting its operating point to the selected computational load, to minimize power consumption. The benefits of the proposed approach are tested on a use-case involving ECG monitoring, that, when selected, performs ECG classification using a lightweigth convolutional neural network. Experimental results show how the proposed approach can provide more than 50% power consumption reduction for common ECG activity, with less than 2% memory footprint overhead and reconfiguring the system in less than 1 ms.},

The contribution of this paper is to contextualize new smart city solutions for integrated city planning and management within the framework of South African policy tools, with the aim of identifying synergies and gaps for future research. This is achieved by carrying out a literature review of existing and emerging tools for integrated decision-making in South African cities and performing a subsequent gap analysis.},

abstract = {There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently, which have not always considered security or data security concerns: A high degree of security is required when considering the sharing of medical data over networks. In most IoT-based systems, especially those within smart-homes and smart-cities, there is a bridging point (fog computing) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks, as well as small amounts of data processing. The fog nodes can have useful knowledge and potential for constructive security and control over both the sensor network and the data transmitted over the Internet. Smart healthcare services utilise such networks of IoT systems. It is therefore vital that medical data emanating from IoT systems is highly secure, to prevent fraudulent use, whilst maintaining quality of service providing assured, verified and complete data. In this article, we examine the development of a Cognitive Fog (CF) model, for secure, smart healthcare services, that is able to make decisions such as opting-in and opting-out from running processes and invoking new processes when required, and providing security for the operational processes within the fog system. Overall, the proposed ensemble security model performed better in terms of Accuracy Rate, Detection Rate, and a lower False Positive Rate (standard intrusion detection measurements) than three base classifiers (K-NN, DBSCAN, and DT) using a standard security dataset (NSL-KDD).},

abstract = {In this research paper, we present a function-based methodology to evaluate the resilience of gas pipeline systems under two different cyber-physical attack scenarios. The first attack scenario is the pressure integrity attack on the natural gas high-pressure transmission pipeline. Through simulations, we have analyzed the cyber attacks that propagate from cyber to the gas pipeline physical domain, the time before which the SCADA system should respond to such attacks, and finally, an attack which prevents the response of the system. We have used the combined results of simulations of a wireless mesh network for remote terminal units and of a gas pipeline simulation to measure the shortest Time to Criticality (TTC) parameter; the time for an event to reach the failure state. The second attack scenario describes how a failure of a cyber node controlling power grid functionality propagates from cyber to power to gas pipeline systems. We formulate this problem using a graph-theoretic approach and quantify the resilience of the networks by percentage of connected nodes and the length of the shortest path between them. The results show that parameters such as TTC, power distribution capacity of the power grid nodes and percentage of the type of cyber nodes compromised, regulate the efficiency and resilience of the power and gas networks. The analysis of such attack scenarios helps the gas pipeline system administrators design attack remediation algorithms and improve the response of the system to an attack.},

These strategies enable development of meaningful security metrics. Adaptive security solutions need security metrics to be able to adapt the relevant security parameters according to contextual and threat changes, which are typical for patient-centric IoT solutions used in various environments. In order to achieve this we have developed a context-aware Markov game theoretic model for security metrics risk impact assessment to measurably evaluate and validate the run-time adaptivity of IoT security solutions.},

We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively.

Furthermore, they are unsuitable for synchronizing data streams that have already been collected. We present CRONOS: a post-hoc, data-driven framework for sensor data synchronization for wearable and Internet-of-Things devices that takes advantage of independent, omni-present motion events in the data streams of two or more sensors.

abstract = {Simulation-based analysis is essential in the model-based design process of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Since heterogeneity is inherent to CPS, virtual prototyping of CPS designs and the simulation of their behavior in various environments typically involve a number of physical and computation/communication domains interacting with each other. Affordability of the model-based design process makes the use of existing domain-specific modeling and simulation tools all but mandatory. However, this pressure establishes the requirement for integrating the domain-specific models and simulators into a semantically consistent and efficient system-of-system simulation. The focus of the paper is the interoperability of popular integration platforms supporting heterogeneous multi-model simulations. We examine the relationship among three existing platforms: the High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based CPS Wind Tunnel (CPSWT), MOSAIK, and the Functional Mockup Unit (FMU).

abstract = {Human Society has evolved unprecedentedly, from mankind living in caves to the most sophisticated and complex physical infrastructures of contemporary technologically advanced era. Model Driven Architecture (MDA), as against code centric approaches, present an abstract view enabling fair visualization of complex systems through abstraction and modelling. In the context of MDA, physical infrastructures need to be modeled and analyzed for model based development of number of interdependent technical systems like Security, Communication, Internet of Things (IOTs), home automation etc. This leads to a dire need of a multipurpose framework, editor and tool for modeling and visualization of physical infrastructures in such a manner that the developed models may be extended, automated and used for variety of domains and in developing various systems. In this article, we propose a framework that not only allows modelling/ planning of complex physical infrastructures but can also be extended for the model based development of wide-ranging systems. In the proposed framework, Physical Infrastructure Multipurpose Meta-Model (PIMM) has been introduced for modeling of both simple as well as complex infrastructures. The feasibility of proposed framework is demonstrated through real world case study. Subsequently, an Eclipse based plugin (PIMM editor) has been developed that allows modeling of physical infrastructures with the help of tree editor. Moreover, for graphical modeling and visualization, Physical Infrastructure Modelling Tool (PIMT) with drag / drop functionality is developed in Sirius and distributed via same plugin. The results prove that the proposed framework supports adequate concepts for the modeling and visualization of physical infrastructures and highly effective for model based systems development related to physical infrastructures.},

abstract = {Energy-neutral Internet of Things requires freeing embedded devices from batteries and powering them from ambient energy. Ambient energy is, however, unpredictable and can only power a device intermittently. Therefore, the paradigm of intermittent execution is to save the program state into non-volatile memory frequently to preserve the execution progress. In task-based intermittent programming, the state is saved at task transition. Tasks are fixed at compile time and agnostic to energy conditions. Thus, the state may be saved either more often than necessary or not often enough for the program to progress and terminate. To address these challenges, we propose Coala, an adaptive and efficient task-based execution model. Coala progresses on a multi-task scale when energy permits and preserves the computation progress on a sub-task scale if necessary. Coala’s specialized memory virtualization mechanism ensures that power failures do not leave the program state in non-volatile memory inconsistent. Our evaluation on a real energy-harvesting platform not only shows that Coala reduces runtime by up to 54% as compared to a state-of-the-art system, but also it is able to progress where static systems fail.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest and research in verifying complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) against rich and expressive specifications [2] such as safety and liveness, to provide formal guarantees for safety-critical systems. While linear temporal logic (LTL) [1] can capture these properties of interest, it is incapable of specifying many information-flow properties that rely on information of multiple traces. These properties, which are described over sets of traces, are called hyperproperties [4] and their corresponding temporal logics have been well studied. The extension of LTL to capture a fragment of hyperproperties, namely, HyperLTL [3], makes use of trace variables to specify individual execution traces and allows for quantification of trace variables to precede a (trace) quantifier-free formula. Here, we present a sound approach for verifying discrete-time control systems against HyperLTL formulae through the use of so-called augmented barrier certificates (ABCs).},

abstract = {The complex interconnections between various critical infrastructure sectors make the system of systems (SoS) vulnerable to failures and highlight the importance of robustness and resilience. To this end, we first establish holistic probabilistic networks to model the interdependencies between infrastructure components. To capture the underlying failure and recovery dynamics, we further propose a Markov decision processes (MDP) model in which the response policy determines a long-term performance. To address the challenge of a large dimensionality, we exploit the sparsity of the network interconnections and solve an approximate linear program by the variable elimination, which leads to a distributed control policy under mild assumptions. Finally, we use a case study of the interdependent power and subway systems to corroborate the results and show that the optimal resilience resource planning and allocation can reduce the failure probability and mitigate the impact of failures caused by natural or artificial disasters.},

Given the recent advances in generative AI, we need new methods to assess and maximize the security of code co-written by machines. As our systems become increasingly heterogeneous, we need practical approaches that work even if some functions are automatically generated, e.g., by deep neural networks. As software systems depend evermore on the software supply chain, we need tools that scale to an entire ecosystem. What kind of vulnerabilities exist in future systems and how do we detect them? When all the shallow bugs are found, how do we discover vulnerabilities hidden deeply in the system? Assuming we cannot find all security flaws, how can we nevertheless protect our system? To answer these questions, we start our roadmap with a survey of recent advances in software security, then discuss open challenges and opportunities, and conclude with a long-term perspective for the field.},

Mediators are elements that facilitate the collaboration between the constituents of the SoS or ecosystem, without having a role outside it. The topic has previously been studied in the SoS field, mainly from a software engineering perspective, and separately also in research on software, business, and innovation ecosystems. This paper presents a systematic literature review on mediators across scholarly work in SoS as well as ecosystems. It identifies mediator functionality and implementation concerns, and discusses alternative terminology. Based on findings from the literature, a suggestion for an improved conceptualization is presented, which also includes the information, processing and interactions involved in the mediation.},

Assuring software safety though traditional V&amp;V has become a tremendous, if not impossible task, given the growing size and complexity of the software.We propose that SWHM (SoftWare Health Management) has the potential to increase safety and reliability of high-assurance software systems. SWHM can build upon the advanced techniques from the area of system health management to continuously monitor the behavior of software during operation, quickly detect anomalies and perform automatic and reliable root-cause analysis. Such a system would not replace traditional V&amp;V, but rather supplement it. The information provided by the SWHM system can be used for automatic mitigation mechanisms (e.g., recovery, dynamic reconfiguration) or presented to a human operator for further analysis. SWHM may also feature a key prognostic capability, which can improve the reliability and availability of the software system because it provides information about soon-to-occur failures or looming performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we discuss research challenges associated with developing an SWHM system, and discuss how Bayesian networks (BN), a key technology used in advanced diagnostics systems may be used for SWHM modeling.},

The approach consists of security domain classification, security metrics use scenarios, modeling and visualization approaches, and monitoring and adaptive decision-making considerations. The underlying digital ecosystem considers a person with a chronic disease as a source of health data for his or her own treatment and other persons with similar conditions. In this type of ecosystems, the role of security effective solutions is important. Especially privacy is emphasized. Therefore, security solutions should be analyzed well in advance, even before specifying the new ecosystem.},

abstract = {Increasing incorporation of advanced information technologies makes business and public organisations more effective and efficient, while often introducing exploitable vulnerabilities. The efficient provision of security of interconnected, and interdependent, processes and sectors against cyberattacks requires deep understanding of vulnerabilities, exposure, potential negative impact, as well as the contribution existing and emerging organisational and technological solutions will potentially have on preventing attacks, reducing vulnerabilities, protecting digital infrastructures, response and recovery, and resilience. Such understanding will allow minimisation of risks against a spectrum of plausible cyber threats and reducing negative consequences of one or a series of cyberattacks.Due to the complexity of the problem, the effective implementation of a number of functions and tasks in designing and operating distributed cyber secure and resilient systems require significant computational resources. This paper outlines six highlevel, computationally demanding functions. The first three relate to the formulation and implementation of cybersecurity policy: understanding risk; planning and implementing cybersecurity measures; and continuous adaptation to the changing technological, threat and policy landscape. The other three functions are operational: situational awareness, including detection of cyberattacks and hybrid malicious activities; operational decision making, e.g. selecting a course of action under attack; and cyber forensics.},

abstract = {Remote Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are technology enablers for major distributed system trends such as mobile and cloud computing and the Internet of Things. In such settings, message-based APIs dominate over procedural and object-oriented ones. It is hard to design such APIs so that they are easy and efficient to use for client developers. Maintaining their runtime qualities while preserving backward compatibility is equally challenging for API providers. For instance, finding a well suited granularity for services and their operations is a particularly important design concern in APIs that realize service-oriented software architectures. Due to the fallacies of distributed computing, the forces for message-based APIs and service interfaces differ from those for local APIs -- for instance, network latency and security concerns deserve special attention. Existing pattern languages have dealt with local APIs in object-oriented programming, with remote objects, with queue-based messaging and with service-oriented computing platforms. However, patterns or equivalent guidance for the structural design of request and response messages in message-based remote APIs is still missing. In this paper, we outline such a pattern language and introduce five basic interface representation patterns to promote platform-independent design advice for common remote API technologies such as RESTful HTTP and Web services (WSDL/SOAP). Known uses and examples of the patterns are drawn from public Web APIs, as well as application development and software integration projects the authors have been involved in.},

abstract = {In an era of complex networked parallel heterogeneous systems, simulating independently only parts, components, or attributes of a system-under-design is a cumbersome, inaccurate, and inefficient approach. Moreover, by considering each part of a system in an isolated manner, and due to the numerous and highly complicated interactions between the different components, the system optimization capabilities are severely limited. The presented fully-distributed simulation framework (called as COSSIM) is the first known open-source, high-performance simulator that can handle holistically system-of-systems including processors, peripherals and networks; such an approach is very appealing to both Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Highly Parallel Heterogeneous Systems designers and application developers. Our highly integrated approach is further augmented with accurate power estimation and security sub-tools that can tap on all system components and perform security and robustness analysis of the overall system under design—something that was unfeasible up to now. Additionally, a sophisticated Eclipse-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed to provide easy simulation setup, execution, and visualization of results. COSSIM has been evaluated when executing the widely used Netperf benchmark suite as well as a number of real-world applications. Final results demonstrate that the presented approach has up to 99% accuracy (when compared with the performance of the real system), while the overall simulation time can be accelerated almost linearly with the number of CPUs utilized by the simulator.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of designing a cyber-physical system where several control loops share the same architectural resources. Typically, the design of such systems proceeds in two steps. In the platform independent step, for each control loop in the system, the control designer calculates a control law and a sampling time that together ensure that the control loop has certain desired performance. Then, in the platform dependent step, these control tasks are scheduled on the platform, and a schedulability analysis determines if (and how) the control laws can be implemented and scheduled without missing the sampling deadlines.In this paper, we explore an alternative controller-scheduler co-design approach that aims to achieve optimal performance for all the individual control loops maintaining fairness. We first analyze the control systems to find out the rates at which control signals should be dropped to maintain schedulability and the optimal performance. We then use the rates to compute a schedule statically. We show a control theoretic approach to compute the effect of the rate of drops on the performance of the control systems and provide an SMT-based scheduling algorithm that takes as input control tasks, their periods, worst-case execution times, and their rate of drops, and outputs a static schedule that optimizes the performance of the control systems. We demonstrate our results through a case study on a family of inverted pendulums sharing the same processor for their control computations.},

Current practices in decision-making are predominantly intuition-driven with attendant challenges for precision and rigor. We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling &amp; Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making. We also discuss the rigor of our validation of the proposed approach and associated technology infrastructure through a representative sample of industry-scale real-world use cases.},

The goal is to help researchers knowing more precisely what is or could be a HDT and an initial step step towards a unifying and generic definition and model grounded in the systemics theory. We propose a systemic model of Digital Twin (DT), where HDT is a specific class of DT. The last years of literature on HDT are reviewed, to build a generic definition, extract the main components and integrate them in a generic systemic model centred on the DT and HDT concepts as systems. Doing this, we make explicit the link between DT and the systems they twin, including the special system that is the human-being, when a DT becomes a HDT.},

abstract = {Systems-of-systems are formed by the composition of independently created software components. These components are designed to satisfy their individual requirements, rather than the global requirements of the systems-of-systems. We refer to components that cannot be adapted to meet both individual and global requirements as "defiant" components. In this paper, we propose a "cautious" adaptation approach which supports changing the behaviour of such defiant components under exceptional conditions to satisfy global requirements, while continuing to guarantee the satisfaction of the components' individual requirements. The approach represents both normal and exceptional conditions as scenarios; models the behaviour of exceptional conditions as wrappers implemented using an aspect-oriented technique; and deals with both single and multiple instances of defiant components with different precedence order at runtime. We evaluated an implementation of the approach using drones and boats for an organ delivery application conceived by our industrial partners, in which we assess how the proposed approach help achieve the system-of-systems' global requirements while accommodating increased complexity of hybrid aspects such as multiplicity, precedence ordering, openness, and heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Embedded systems omnipresent in everyday life and industry are mainly composed of hardware and software that must comply with a number of standards and regulations. However, there is no consensus on the quality characteristics and subcharacteristics of embedded software. This article presents the steps for modeling an operational quality model for embedded software aligned with the ISO 25000 series of quality models for traditional computer systems. From a literature review composed of 40 studies on quality modeling for embedded systems and software, 85 of the most frequent quality characteristics and subcharacteristics were first identified, including a subset of 16 referenced or cited in at least 25% of the literature. Next, the design of a quality model for embedded software aligned with the ISO 25000 series was proposed with 13 characteristics and 27 subcharacteristics. The operational aspect of this quality model for embedded software is addressed next through a set of measures and measurement functions from ISO 25000 to aggregate the results of the quantification of the characteristics and subcharacteristics. A survey involving 25 embedded software specialists is presented next to gauge, using Fleiss's Kappa criteria, their agreement with the proposed quality model. Furthermore, the computed importance weights derived from the survey participants’ individual opinions were compared with those derived from an analysis of 40 embedded software studies, bolstering the credibility of the model. The results of this study suggest that the proposed quality model can serve as a framework for evaluating and understanding the quality characteristics across diverse expertise levels. Furthermore, the convergence between the survey and the literature strengthens the model's credibility by anchoring it in both established literature and practitioners’ agreements.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are required to satisfy safety constraints in various application domains such as robotics, industrial manufacturing systems, and power systems. Faults and cyber attacks have been shown to cause safety violations, which can damage the system and endanger human lives. Resilient architectures have been proposed to ensure safety of CPS under such faults and attacks via methodologies including redundancy and restarting from safe operating conditions. The existing resilient architectures for CPS utilize different mechanisms to guarantee safety, and currently, there is no common framework to compare them. Moreover, the analysis and design undertaken for CPS employing one architecture is not readily extendable to another. In this article, we propose a timing-based framework for CPS employing various resilient architectures and develop a common methodology for safety analysis and computation of control policies and design parameters. Using the insight that the cyber subsystem operates in one out of a finite number of statuses, we first develop a hybrid system model that captures CPS adopting any of these architectures. Based on the hybrid system, we formulate the problem of joint computation of control policies and associated timing parameters for CPS to satisfy a given safety constraint and derive sufficient conditions for the solution. Utilizing the derived conditions, we provide an algorithm to compute control policies and timing parameters relevant to the employed architecture. We also note that our solution can be applied to a wide class of CPS with polynomial dynamics and also allows incorporation of new architectures. We verify our proposed framework by performing a case study on adaptive cruise control of vehicles.},

abstract = {A demand response scheme that uses direct device control to actively exploit prosumer flexibility has been identified as a key remedy to meet the challenge of increased renewable energy sources integration. Although a number of direct control-based demand response solutions exist and have been successfully deployed and demonstrated in the real world, they are typically designed for, and are effective only at small scale and/or target specific types of loads, leading to relatively high cost-of-entry. This prohibits deploying scalable solutions.The H2020 GOFLEX project has addressed this issue and developed a scalable, general, and replicable so-called GOFLEX system, which offers a market-driven approach to solve congestion problems in distribution grids based on aggregated individual flexibilities from a wide range of prosumers, both small (incl. electric vehicles, heat-pumps, boilers, freezers, fridges) and large (incl. factories, water pumping stations, etc.). By encompassing individual prosumers, aggregators, distribution system operators, and energy multi-utilities and retailers. It is a system of systems, where all flexibilities in electricity demand, production, and storage are extracted, (dis)aggregated, optimized, and traded using the powerful and standardized FlexOffer format, yielding a general and replicable solution with low cost-of-entry. The system has been successfully deployed in Switzerland, Germany, and Cyprus where it has controlled loads of 500+ prosumers, with a total of 800MWh flexibility offered on the market, offering up to 64% of adaptability in peak demand. In this paper, we present the overall architecture of the GOFLEX system, its sub-systems, and the interaction between these sub-systems. We then discuss the configurations, observations, and key results of using the GOFLEX system both in the aforementioned 3 demo sites - within the GOFLEX project and after the project.},

abstract = {To guarantee the safety and security of a real-time mobile system such as an intelligent transportation system, it is necessary to model and analyze its behaviors prior to actual development. In particular, the mobile objects in such systems must be isolated from each other so that they do not collide with each other. Since isolation means two or more mobile objects must not be located in the same place at the same time, a scheduling policy is required to control and coordinate the movement of such objects. However, traditional scheduling theories are based on task scheduling which is coarse-grained and cannot be directly used for fine-grained isolation controls. In this article, we first propose a fine-grained event-based formal model called a time dependency structure and use it to model and analyze real-time mobile systems. Next, an event-based schedule is defined and the composition of schedules is discussed. Then, we investigate the schedulability of isolation—that is, checking whether a given schedule ensures the isolation relationship among mobile objects or not. After that, we present an automation approach for scheduling generation to guarantee isolation controls in real-time mobile systems. Finally, case studies and simulation experiments demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) refer to the next generation of embedded ICT systems that are interconnected, collaborative and that provide users and businesses with a wide range of smart applications and services. Software in CPS applications ranges from small systems to large systems, aka. Systems of Systems (SoS), such as smart grids and cities. CPSoS require managing massive amounts of data, being aware of their emerging behavior, and scaling out to progressively evolve and add new systems. Cloud computing supports processing and storing massive amounts of data, hosting and delivering services, and configuring self-provisioned resources. Therefore, cloud computing is the natural candidate to solve CPSoS needs. However, the diversity of platforms and the low-level cloud programming models make difficult to find a common solution for the development and deployment of CPSoS. This paper presents the architectural foundations of a cloud-centric framework for automating the development and deployment of CPSoS service applications to converge towards a common open service platform for CPSoS applications. This framework relies on the well-known qualities of the microservices architecture style, the autonomic computing paradigm, and the model-driven software development approach. Its implementation and validation is on-going at two European and national projects.},

abstract = {An increasing interest in researching the development, integration, composition, and evolution of large-scale, software-intensive systems (LSSIS) have been observed in the last years. These systems are presented in different domains as connected health, industry 4.0, military, smart cities, smart grids, and smart agriculture. These systems are realized through the cooperation among heterogeneous, independent, highly distributed, individual, and heterogeneous systems to achieve their business goals. For the success of these larger systems, their individual parts must interoperate among them allowing the execution of more complex functionalities. However, there are many concerns that software engineers must overcome during the composition of these systems, that can be related to (i) the misunderstanding of data formats, data semantic, procedures, contracts, standards, quality, and interfaces structures provided by individual systems; and (ii) the absence of high-level architectures to analyze, comprehend, and guide how interoperability can be addressed. The goal of this work is to present a typology of existing and proven strategies for achieving interoperability. Strategies were identified through a systematic search in scientific databases and patterns repositories. The selected strategies were categorized according to the level of interoperability they support, namely, technical, syntactic, semantic, and organizational. In each level, the strategies were divided by the type of solution their propose, i.e., technique, and architectural styles, patterns, and tactics. Moreover, statements explaining how each strategy address interoperability are given. Results of this work can be used by architects to identify and understand solutions for achieving interoperability requirements during the composition of larger systems. The resulting typology in this study is the first step to consolidate a patterns-language for interoperability in software architectures.},

abstract = {Embedded systems must address a multitude of potentially conflicting design constraints such as resiliency, energy, heat, cost, performance, security, etc., all in the face of highly dynamic operational behaviors and environmental conditions. By incorporating elements of intelligence, the hope is that the resulting “smart” embedded systems will function correctly and within desired constraints in spite of highly dynamic changes in the applications and the environment, as well as in the underlying software/hardware platforms. Since terms related to “smartness” (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptivity, and autonomy) have been used loosely in many software and hardware computing contexts, we first present a taxonomy of “self-x” terms and use this taxonomy to relate major “smart” software and hardware computing efforts. A major attribute for smart embedded systems is the notion of self-awareness that enables an embedded system to monitor its own state and behavior, as well as the external environment, so as to adapt intelligently. Toward this end, we use a System-on-Chip perspective to show how the CyberPhysical System-on-Chip (CPSoC) exemplar platform achieves self-awareness through a combination of cross-layer sensing, actuation, self-aware adaptations, and online learning. We conclude with some thoughts on open challenges and research directions.},

abstract = {The world's computing infrastructure is increasingly differentiating into self-contained distributed systems with various purposes and capabilities (e.g. IoT installations, clouds, VANETs, WSNs, CDNs, . . .). Furthermore, such systems are increasingly being composed to generate systems of systems that offer value-added functionality. Today, however, system of systems composition is typically ad-hoc and fragile. It requires developers to possess an intimate knowledge of system internals and low-level interactions between their components. In this paper, we outline a vision and set up a research agenda towards the generalised programmatic construction of distributed systems as compositions of other distributed systems. Our vision, in which we refer uniformly to systems and to compositions of systems as holons, employs code generation techniques and uses common abstractions, operations and mechanisms at all system levels to support uniform system of systems composition. We believe our holon approach could facilitate a step change in the convenience and correctness with which systems of systems can be built, and open unprecedented opportunities for the emergence of new and previously-unenvisaged distributed system deployments, analogous perhaps to the impact the mashup culture has had on the way we now build web applications.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (SoSs) are large-scale systems made of independent and autonomous cyber-physical Constituent Systems (CSs) which may interoperate to achieve high-level goals also with the intervention of humans. Providing security in such SoSs means, among other features, forecasting and anticipating evolving SoS functionalities, ultimately identifying possible detrimental phenomena that may result from the interactions of CSs and humans. Such phenomena, usually called emergent phenomena, are often complex and difficult to capture: the first appearance of an emergent phenomenon in a cyber-physical SoS is often a surprise to the observers. Adequate support to understand emergent phenomena will assist in reducing both the likelihood of design or operational flaws, and the time needed to analyze the relations amongst the CSs, which always has a key economic significance. This article presents a threat analysis methodology and a supporting tool aimed at (i) identifying (emerging) threats in evolving SoSs, (ii) reducing the cognitive load required to understand an SoS and the relations among CSs, and (iii) facilitating SoS risk management by proposing mitigation strategies for SoS administrators. The proposed methodology, as well as the tool, is empirically validated on Smart Grid case studies by submitting questionnaires to a user base composed of 3 stakeholders and 18 BSc and MSc students.},

The underlying assumption is that the functional behavior of a model is related to the behavior of a more concretized model or the real system. A formal definition of such a relation is called conformance relation. There are a variety of conformance relations, and the question arises of how to select a conformance relation for the development of CPS. The contribution of this article is a survey of the definitions and algorithms of conformance relations for CPS. Additionally, the article compares several conformance relations and provides guidance on which relation to select for specific problems. Finally, we discuss how to select inputs for testing conformance.},

abstract = {Having a sustained human presence on the lunar surface is a central objective of the Artemis Program, as it represents a key pre-requisite in resource mining operations on the Moon as well as an important steppingstone for future Martian exploration and colonization. Despite its importance, this endeavor has little precedent to rely on to inform the many challenges it needs to address. Digital Twin, in recent years, has been employed in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we explore its usefulness in establishing the Artemis Base Camp. Digital twins can be applied to various stages of the lifecycle of the lunar base development. We also identify several open questions that need be addressed before the digital twin can be utilized effectively in this project. In fact, addressing these questions could facilitate deploying digital twins in use cases in a wider spectrum of industries and sectors.},

abstract = {Smart government (SG) is an emerging topic, which increasingly attracts attention from scholars who work in public administration, political, and information sciences. Smart city (SC) on the other hand, is an emerging and multidisciplinary domain of study. It is not clear whether the two terms SG and SC co-exist or concern different domains that interrelate and interact. The aim of this paper is to investigate the term SG; to conceptualize it with components; to define the importance of these components to the SG with their relative strengths; and to clarify its relationship with the SC term. In this respect, this paper follows a multi-method approach: a comprehensive literature review to define and conceptualize the SG, and determine its components, and a Delphi study for validating the literature findings and for calculating the relative components’ strengths. The SG definitions that are in literature have several weaknesses and the authors proposed a definition to the SG that overcomes them, while a model with three rings, three dimensions and 13 components conceptualizes it. The Delphi study showed that all the SG conceptual entities are useful, and highlighted that Citizens Engagement, Economic Growth, and Accountability are more important compared to the others, but it is hard to decide about the less important component. Third, the ICT Innovation entity appears to be the most important compared to emerging technologies and data. Finally, SC and SG are indeed related but, SC is proved to be a complimentary part of the broader SG term.},

abstract = {Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (sCPS) are a novel kind of Cyber- Physical Systems engineered to take advantage of large-scale cooperation between devices, users and environment to achieve added value in face of uncertainty and various situations in their environment. Examples of sCPS include modern traffic systems, Industry 4.0 systems, systems for smart-buildings, smart energy grids, etc. The uniting aspect of all these systems is that to achieve their high-level of intelligence, adaptivity and ability to optimize and learn, they heavily rely on software. This makes them software-intensive systems, where software becomes their most complex part. Engineering sCPS thus becomes a recognized software engineering discipline, which however, due to specifics of sCPS, can only partially rely on the existing body of knowledge in software engineering. In fact, it turns out that many of the traditional approaches to architecture modeling and software development fail to cope with the high dynamicity and uncertainty of sCPS. This calls for innovative approaches that jointly reflect and address the specifics of such systems. This paper maps the discussions and results of the Third International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (SEsCPS 2017), which specifically focuses on challenges and promising solutions in the area of software engineering for sCPS.},

abstract = {Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) have emerged over the past two decades as a means to abstract details of large-scale systems in order to enable better intellectual control over the complete systems. Recently, there has been an explosion in the number of ADLs created in the research community. However, industrial adoption of these ADLs has been rather limited. This has been attributed to various reasons, including the lack of support of some ADLs for: variability management, requirements traceability, architectural artefact reusability and multiple architectural views. To overcome these limitations, this paper is a report on ALI, an ADL that was designed to complement existing work by adding mechanisms to address the aforementioned limitations. The ALI design principles, concepts, notations and formal semantics are presented in this paper. The notation is illustrated using two distinct case studies, one from the information systems domain " an Asset Management System (AMS); and another from the embedded systems domain - a Wheel Brake System (WBS).},

In the ICT domain, ensuring the integrity of the supply chain is becoming an essential concern, as components are often manufactured, owned, and operated by different entities across the globe; thus, the cascading effects from a single attack may have a widely propagated impact. This is even more so when components are used in industrial control systems in critical infrastructures. It is therefore important to understand such attacks and attack vectors, the security challenges thereof, and measures to mitigate these; it is also important to educate cybersecurity professionals on these issues. This paper systematizes the security threats and challenges in digital supply chains, as well as relevant cybersecurity measures, discusses the necessary knowledge and skills that cybersecurity professionals should possess to ensure efficient management of the cyber risks in the digital supply chain, and systematizes areas where further research is needed.},

abstract = {Autonomous systems are increasingly prevalent around the world, with the benefits related to safety, efficiency, and sustainability attractive in addition to the opportunity to establish entirely new capabilities. In order to operationalise autonomous systems technology it is critical to have in place the legal, regulatory and ethical infrastructure necessary to enable safe and trusted operation. While there is a growing body of literature regarding ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is a need for more academic exploration of legal and regulatory best practice for autonomous systems used in commercial and defence contexts. This paper addresses that literature gap by considering the role of regulation and its relationship with trust in a multi-disciplinary context, before proposing 10 principles to base regulatory development and implementation on. These principles, Trust-centred; Collaborative; Risk-based; Evidence-led; Facilitate experimentation; Systems-focussed; Usable; Consistent; Adaptable and Reviewable, collectively provide a domain and technology agnostic basis for a regulatory framework development and implementation approach that supports the design, manufacture and operation of safe and trusted autonomous systems. The paper concludes by recommending next steps towards the regulation of safe and trusted autonomous systems, including a focus on collaboration and experimentation.},

abstract = {Many modern cyber-physical systems (CPS), especially industrial automation systems, require the actions of multiple computational systems to be performed at much higher rates and more tightly synchronized than is possible with ad hoc designs. Time is the common entity that computing and physical systems in CPS share, and correct interfacing of that is essential to flawless functionality of a CPS. Fundamental research is needed on ways to synchronize clocks of computing systems to a high degree, and on design methods that enable building blocks of CPS to perform actions at specified times. To realize the potential of CPS in the coming decades, suitable ways to specify distributed CPS applications are needed, including their timing requirements, ways to specify the timing of the CPS components (e.g. sensors, actuators, computing platform), timing analysis to determine if the application design is possible using the components, confident top-down design methodologies that can ensure that the system meets its timing requirements, and ways and methodologies to test and verify that the system meets the timing requirements. Furthermore, strategies for securing timing need to be carefully considered at every CPS design stage and not simply added on. This paper exposes these challenges of CPS development, points out limitations of previous approaches, and provides some research directions towards solving these challenges.},

abstract = {Since its inception, underwater digital acoustic communication has required custom hardware that neither has the economies of scale nor is pervasive. We present the first acoustic system that brings underwater messaging capabilities to existing mobile devices like smartphones and smart watches. Our software-only solution leverages audio sensors, i.e., microphones and speakers, ubiquitous in today's devices to enable acoustic underwater communication between mobile devices. To achieve this, we design a communication system that in real-time adapts to differences in frequency responses across mobile devices, changes in multipath and noise levels at different locations and dynamic channel changes due to mobility. We evaluate our system in six different real-world underwater environments with depths of 2--15 m in the presence of boats, ships and people fishing and kayaking. Our results show that our system can in real-time adapt its frequency band and achieve bit rates of 100 bps to 1.8 kbps and a range of 30 m. By using a lower bit rate of 10--20 bps, we can further increase the range to 100 m. As smartphones and watches are increasingly being used in underwater scenarios, our software-based approach has the potential to make underwater messaging capabilities widely available to anyone with a mobile device.Project page with open-source code and data can be found here: https://underwatermessaging.cs.washington.edu/},

abstract = {The Arm Triple Core Lock-Step (TCLS) architecture is the natural evolution of Arm Cortex-R Dual Core Lock-Step (DCLS) processors to increase dependability, predictability, and availability in safety-critical and ultra-reliable applications. TCLS is simple, scalable, and easy to deploy in applications where Arm DCLS processors are widely used (e.g., automotive), as well as in new sectors where the presence of Arm technology is incipient (e.g., enterprise) or almost non-existent (e.g., space). Specifically in space, COTS Arm processors provide optimal power-to-performance, extensibility, evolvability, software availability, and ease of use, especially in comparison with the decades old rad-hard computing solutions that are still in use. This article discusses the fundamentals of an Arm Cortex-R5 based TCLS processor, providing key functioning and implementation details. The article shows that the TCLS architecture keeps the use of rad-hard technology to a minimum, namely, using rad-hard by design standard cell libraries only to protect the critical parts that account for less than 4% of the entire TCLS solution. Moreover, when exposure to radiation is relatively low, such as in terrestrial applications or even satellites operating in Low Earth Orbits (LEO), the system could be implemented entirely using commercial cell libraries, relying on the radiation mitigation methods implemented on the TCLS to cope with sporadic soft errors in its critical parts. The TCLS solution allows thus to significantly reduce chip manufacturing costs and keep pace with advances in low power consumption and high density integration by leveraging commercial semiconductor processes, while matching the reliability levels and improving availability that can be achieved using extremely expensive rad-hard semiconductor processes. Finally, the article describes a TRL4 proof-of-concept TCLS-based System-on-Chip (SoC) that has been prototyped and tested to power the computer on-board an Airbus Defence and Space telecom satellite. When compared to the currently used processor solution by Airbus, the TCLS-based SoC results in a more than 5\texttimes{} performance increase and cuts power consumption by more than half.},

abstract = {Recent blockchain-technology related innovations enable the governance of collaborating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to engage in agile business-network collaborations that are based on the novel concept of smart contracting. DAOs utilize service-oriented cloud computing in a loosely coupled collaboration lifecycle with the main steps of setup, enactment, possible rollbacks and finally, an orderly termination. This lifecycle supports the selection of services provided and used by DAOs, smart contract negotiations, and behavior monitoring during enactment with the potential for breach management. Based on a sound understanding of the collaboration lifecycle in a Governance- as-a-Service (GaaS)-platform, a new type of conflict management must safeguard business-semantics induced consistency rules. This conflict management involves breach detection with recovery aspects. To fill the detected gap, we employ a formal design-notation that comprises the definition of structural and behavioral properties for exploring conflict-related exception- and compensation management during a decentralized collaboration. With the formal approach, we generate a highly dependable DAO-GaaS conflict model that does not collapse under left-behind clutter such as orphaned processes and exponentially growing database entries that require an unacceptable periodic GaaS reset.},

abstract = {Software development in wireless sensor networks has traditionally focused on stand-alone applications statically linked with the operating system code, and relying on fixed models for scheduling, synchronization, and resource allocation. Middleware services and network protocols, are usually considered to be part of the operating system. As the number of available WSN platforms and operating systems grows, and the emergence of cyber-physical systems results in the creation of networks of hetrogeneous devices (sensor nodes, microcontrollers, mobile devices, etc.), portability and interoperation emerge as major considerations in the software development process. We propose breaking the tight integration between middleware services and the operating system. We demonstrate how adopting a service-oriented computing approach to WSN middleware services improves portability and enables the creation of heterogeneous sensor networks and cyber-physical systems. The adoption of a service-oriented architecture does not necessarily translate into a significant loss of performance. An extremely light-weight and flexible method for local and remote service interaction is proposed.},

abstract = {Wireless reprogramming of sensor nodes is a critical requirement in long-lived wireless sensor networks (WSNs) addressing several concerns, such as fixing bugs, upgrading the operating system and applications, and adapting applications behavior according to the physical environment. In such resource-poor platforms, the ability to efficiently delimit and reconfigure the necessary portion of sensor software—instead of updating the full binary image—is of vital importance. However, most existing approaches in this field have not been adopted widely to date due to the extensive use of WSN resources or lack of generality. In this article, we therefore consider WSN programming models and runtime reconfiguration models as two interrelated factors and we present an integrated approach for addressing efficient reprogramming in WSNs. The middleware solution we propose, &lt;scp&lt;RemoWare&lt;/scp&lt;, is characterized by mitigating the cost of post-deployment software updates on sensor nodes via the notion of in situ reconfigurability and providing a component-based programming abstraction in order to facilitate the development of dynamic WSN applications. Our evaluation results show that &lt;scp&lt;RemoWare&lt;/scp&lt; imposes a very low energy overhead in code distribution and component reconfiguration and consumes approximately 6% of the total code memory on a &lt;scp&lt;TelosB&lt;/scp&lt; sensor platform.},

I present a resource-oriented solution to this problem by introducing a RESTful representation of resources' actions. Using a web tasker, like the browser counterpart, users can express their tasks by selecting resource and its action. They can also specify conditions for executions as well as sequences of resource actions as hypermedia links of actions.

This monitoring system utilizes deep learning neural networks to detect anomalies in near-real-time in multiple Platform components simultaneously.After running the system for a year, we observed that the proposed solution frees the DevOps team's time and human resources from manually monitoring thousands of Cloud components. Moreover, it increases customer satisfaction by reducing the risk of Cloud outages.In this paper, we share our solutions' architecture, implementation notes, and best practices that emerged while evolving the monitoring system.

abstract = {Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) serves as a basis for a wide spectrum of applications, including software plagiarism, malware classification, and known vulnerability discovery. However, the inference of contextual meanings of a binary is challenging due to the absence of semantic information available in source codes. Recent advances leverage the benefits of a deep learning architecture into a better understanding of underlying code semantics and the advantages of the Siamese architecture into better BCSD. In this paper, we propose BinShot, a BERT-based similarity learning architecture that is highly transferable for effective BCSD. We tackle the problem of detecting code similarity with one-shot learning (a special case of few-shot learning). To this end, we adopt a weighted distance vector with a binary cross entropy as a loss function on top of BERT. With the prototype of BinShot, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, and practicality of BinShot, which is robust to detecting the similarity of previously unseen functions. We show that BinShot outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches for BCSD.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges for underwater applications, such as environmental monitoring and disaster management, is achieving efficient data transmission in environments where conditions change rapidly, and resources need for data transport are scarce. The capability of evaluating the Value of information (VoI) enables us to assess these problems by proposing a Value of Information-based Situation-Aware Non-Linear Routing (VoI SANLR/VoI SANL) method. It aims to deal with critical event scenarios using BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) logic criteria and prioritizing the timely uploading of data-driven information towards the destination. SANLR of VoI is developed to reduce energy consumption, end-to-end latency, jitter, and improve Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) in underwater communication networks. VoI SANLR introduces principles of priority-based methods and intends to address challenges in terms of underwater environment such as varying channel conditions, lack energy resources, and real-time decision requirements by using SANLR. Energy optimization analysis reveals consistent outperformance, achieving a remarkable 95% reduction in energy consumption compared to other techniques. Low latency is maintained, ranging from 2.5 to 0.5 seconds, showcasing enhanced efficiency and scalability. VoI SANLR demonstrates exceptional performance in both throughput and jitter. It achieves the highest data transfer rates, ranging from 100 kbps to 110 kbps, indicating outstanding efficiency. Additionally, the jitter remains consistently low, between 1.8 ms and 2 ms, ensuring minimal delay variability and improved communication stability. PDR consistently surpasses other techniques, reaching a maximum of 99%. Additionally, network lifetime analysis demonstrates VoI SANLR's superiority, exhibiting the highest network lifetime at each node and a significant 31.25% improvement at Node 100 compared to other methods.},

abstract = {Modeling and simulation have been around for years and its application to study several different systems and processes have proven its practical importance. Various research has sought to optimize its performance and capabilities, but few address the issues of generating realistic inputs for simulating into the future. In this paper, some issues in the commonly used simulation flow were identified and deep learning was introduced to enhance realism by learning historical data progressively, so as to generate realistic inputs to a simulation model. We focus on improving the input generation phase and not the model of the system itself. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that realizes the possibility of integrating deep learning models directly into simulation models for general-purpose applications. Experiments showed that the proposed methods are able to achieve higher overall accuracy in generating input sequences as compared to current state-of-art.},

The audit report recommends requiring "all AM systems to obtain an authority to operate in accordance with DoD policy before their use" [1], and requiring "AM system owners to immediately identify and implement security controls to minimize risk until obtaining an authority to operate." [1] The DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) responded that existing DoD regulations require both of these for "all IT systems, including AM systems" [1]. Such cyber security rules can help guard against vulnerabilities such as design file theft or digital thread hacking, as well as unauthorized prints on AM systems that can impact the safety and integrity of parts used in defense systems, expose critical intellectual property to bad actors and even cause manufacturing facilities to shut down. To improve AM system vendors' understanding of these cybersecurity requirements for DoD and the US Government (USG), we discuss in this paper the process for obtaining an Authority To Operate (ATO) certification for an IT system per DoD and USG cybersecurity regulations, i.e., the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [2]. We also describe resources for AM system vendors to understand and implement the RMF process for obtaining an ATO certification, particularly in the DoD environment.

Hence our system enables not only conventional sensing in terms of range, velocity, and orientation estimation but also allows for information to be conveyed by the sensed device. We introduce the design of a metasurface driven by an energy-efficient programmable piezo-electric actuator, detail suitable radar processing, and characterize the link performance of the kinetically induced channel at distances up to five meters. As this metasurface could be used for both mobile devices and infrastructure devices, we describe opportunities for enabling novel capabilities including secure device authentication and extended-range wireless sensing across multiple devices.},

abstract = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems have received much recent attention due to their human-level accuracy. While existing works mostly focus on either improving accuracy or testing accuracy robustness, the computation efficiency of NMT systems, which is of paramount importance due to often vast translation demands and real-time requirements, has surprisingly received little attention. In this paper, we make the first attempt to understand and test potential computation efficiency robustness in state-of-the-art NMT systems. By analyzing the working mechanism and implementation of 1455 public-accessible NMT systems, we observe a fundamental property in NMT systems that could be manipulated in an adversarial manner to reduce computation efficiency significantly. Our interesting observation is that the output length determines the computation efficiency of NMT systems instead of the input, where the output length depends on two factors: an often sufficiently large yet pessimistic pre-configured threshold controlling the max number of iterations and a runtime generated end of sentence (EOS) token. Our key motivation is to generate test inputs that could sufficiently delay the generation of EOS such that NMT systems would have to go through enough iterations to satisfy the pre-configured threshold. We present NMTSloth, which develops a gradient-guided technique that searches for a minimal and unnoticeable perturbation at character-level, token-level, and structure-level, which sufficiently delays the appearance of EOS and forces these inputs to reach the naturally-unreachable threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of NMTSloth, we conduct a systematic evaluation on three public-available NMT systems: Google T5, AllenAI WMT14, and Helsinki-NLP translators. Experimental results show that NMTSloth can increase NMT systems' response latency and energy consumption by 85% to 3153% and 86% to 3052%, respectively, by perturbing just one character or token in the input sentence. Our case study shows that inputs generated by NMTSloth significantly affect the battery power in real-world mobile devices (i.e., drain more than 30 times battery power than normal inputs).},

It is acknowledged as a reliable answer to the identification of zero-day attacks to such extent, several ML algorithms that suit for binary classification have been proposed throughout years. However, the experimental comparison of a wide pool of unsupervised algorithms for anomaly-based intrusion detection against a comprehensive set of attacks datasets was not investigated yet. To fill such gap, we exercise 17 unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms on 11 attack datasets. Results allow elaborating on a wide range of arguments, from the behavior of the individual algorithm to the suitability of the datasets to anomaly detection. We conclude that algorithms as Isolation Forests, One-Class Support Vector Machines, and Self-Organizing Maps are more effective than their counterparts for intrusion detection, while clustering algorithms represent a good alternative due to their low computational complexity. Further, we detail how attacks with unstable, distributed, or non-repeatable behavior such as Fuzzing, Worms, and Botnets are more difficult to detect. Ultimately, we digress on capabilities of algorithms in detecting anomalies generated by a wide pool of unknown attacks, showing that achieved metric scores do not vary with respect to identifying single attacks.},

abstract = {Digital twin has emerged as a key technology in the era of smart manufacturing and holds significant potential for maintenance. However, gaps remain in understanding stakeholders' requirements and how this technology support maintenance-related decisions. This paper aims to identify stakeholders' requirements for digital twin implementation and examine the role of digital twin in supporting maintenance actions and decision-making process. Semi-structured interviews and a workshop involving manufacturing practitioners and researchers were conducted to attain these goals. Furthermore, an in-depth qualitative analysis of the interview data was carried out. The results shed light on the current state of digital twin adoption, implementation challenges, requirements, supported decisions and actions, and future demand characteristics. By integrating the findings from the literature review and interview analysis, this study outlines the requirements for the digital twins as expressed by industry stakeholders that will be used and tested in the drone factory digital twin model.},

In this paper, we take a look at two examples of such successful attacks to put the idea of Supply Chain Attacks into perspective, and analyse how EU and national law can prevent these attacks or otherwise punish companies which do not try to mitigate them at all possible costs. We find that the current types of national regulation are not technology specific enough, and cannot force or otherwise mandate the correct parties who could play the biggest role in preventing supply chain attacks to do everything in their power to mitigate them. But, current EU law is on the right path, and further development of this may be what is necessary to combat these large threats, as national law may fail at properly regulating companies when it comes to cybersecurity.},

Prior work in the HCI and CSCW communities has focused on how social media can be vital during natural disasters; non-social media technologies have been under-researched. To understand how technology other than social media can support or harm people during crises, we explore hurricane survivors' use and disuse of multiple kinds of technologies in online surveys with 138 US participants. We find substantial technology use supporting survivors' comfort and safety other than social media. We also observe that designing technologies for high-resource environments--as with many mainstream apps--causes users to decrease use of potentially critical technologies during utility outages, which are common during hurricanes. With themes of both (a) broad technology use and (b) conditions preventing technology use, we make recommendations for technical design, policy, and research to empower communities susceptible to hurricanes.},

Simulatable digital twins have become critical aids for analyzing and adapting complex systems. Design thinking and service design methodologies, in contrast, are gaining momentum for ideation, subjective evaluation, and innovation. A systematic application of these methodologies to explore innovative ideas and a faithful virtual environment to test and fine-tune those ideas without impacting real systems could be transformational. This paper presents an approach that establishes a symbiotic relationship between these two approaches to introduce precision and innovativeness to make enterprises resilient. We describe the key characteristics of resilient enterprises, present our approach, and illustrate its effectiveness with a case study focusing on a transformation toward a new normal to address the Covid-19 pandemic induced disruptions in the IT industry.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have received much recent attention due to their human-level accuracy. While existing works mostly focus on either improving accuracy or testing accuracy robustness, the computation efficiency of LLMs, which is of paramount importance due to often vast generation demands and real-time requirements, has surprisingly received little attention. In this article, we make the first attempt to understand and test potential computation efficiency robustness in state-of-the-art LLMs. By analyzing the working mechanism and implementation of 20,543 public-accessible LLMs, we observe a fundamental property in LLMs that could be manipulated in an adversarial manner to reduce computation efficiency significantly. Our interesting observation is that the output length determines the computation efficiency of LLMs instead of the input, where the output length depends on two factors: an often sufficiently large yet pessimistic pre-configured threshold controlling the max number of iterations and a runtime-generated end of sentence (EOS) token. Our key motivation is to generate test inputs that could sufficiently delay the generation of EOS such that LLMs would have to go through enough iterations to satisfy the pre-configured threshold. We present LLMEffiChecker, which can work under both white-box setting and black-box setting. In the white-box scenario, LLMEffiChecker develops a gradient-guided technique that searches for a minimal and unnoticeable perturbation at character-level, token-level, and structure-level. In the black-box scenario, LLMEffiChecker employs a causal inference-based approach to find critical tokens and similarly applies three levels of imperceptible perturbation to them. Both the white-box and black-box settings effectively delay the appearance of EOS, compelling these inputs to reach the naturally unreachable threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMEffiChecker, we conduct a systematic evaluation on nine publicly available LLMs: Google T5, AllenAI WMT14, Helsinki-NLP translator, Facebook FairSeq, UNICAMP-DL translator, MarianMT, Google FLAN-T5, MBZUAI LaMini-GPT, and Salesforce CodeGen. Experimental results show that LLMEffiChecker can increase on average LLMs’ response latency and energy consumption by 325% to 3,244% and 344% to 3,616%, respectively, by perturbing just one character or token in the input sentence. Our case study shows that inputs generated by LLMEffiChecker significantly affect the battery power in real-world mobile devices (i.e., drain more than 30 times battery power than normal inputs).},

abstract = {The immense flood of alerts that is constantly produced in large-scale control systems (LSCS) of critical infrastructures, ranging from energy and ICT to traffic, represents a substantial challenge for efficient and safe operation. Although research for reducing alert floods exists since decades, mining of appropriate alert patterns as the ultimate means to cope with alert quantity is especially challenged since relationships between alerts are commonly unknown, due to heterogeneity, size, and evolutionary nature of LSCS.Thus, this paper contributes an alert-driven pattern mining approach based on a hybrid, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm being unique in two directions. First, pattern quality is optimized by maximizing both, pattern size in terms of how many alerts are covered by a single pattern occurrence and pattern confidence taking into consideration how many alert occurrences are covered by repeated pattern occurrences, thus allowing for a two-dimensional flood reduction. Secondly, pattern coverage is maximized, ensuring that each alert occurrence is pinned down within a pattern and at the same time allowing for various patterns to be identified for a single alert, thus facilitating a multi-faceted flood reduction. Based on real-world log data in the area of road traffic management, the applicability of our approach is demonstrated.},

Current commercial solutions are inefficient as they are based on brute-forcing strategies that use wordlists, resulting in enormous quantities of trials for a small amount of success.Offensive AI is a recent paradigm that integrates AI-based technologies in cyber attacks. In this work, we explore whether AI can enhance the directory enumeration process and propose a novel Language Model-based framework.

abstract = {We consider the decentralized controller synthesis problem for multi-agent systems with global reach-avoid specifications. Each agent is modeled as a nonlinear dynamical system with disturbances. The objective is to synthesize local feedback controllers that guarantee that the overall multi-agent system meets the global specification despite the influence of disturbances. On the one hand, existing techniques based on planning or trajectory optimization usually ignore the effects of disturbances and produce open-loop nominal trajectories that are not generally sufficient in the presence of disturbances. On the other hand, techniques based on formal synthesis, which guarantee satisfaction of temporal specifications, do not scale as the number of agents increases.We address these limitations by proposing a two-level solution approach that combines fast global nominal trajectory generation and local application of formal synthesis. At the top level, we ignore the effect of disturbances and obtain a joint open-loop plan for the system using a fast trajectory optimizer. At the lower level, we use abstraction-based controller design to synthesize a set of decentralized feedback controllers that track the high level plan against worst-case disturbances, thus ensuring satisfaction of the global specification.We provide the implementation of our approach in an open-source tool called GAMARA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GAMARA on several multi-robot examples using two particular classes of control specifications. In the first type, we assume that the robots need to fulfill their own reach-avoid tasks while avoiding collision with each other. In the second type, we require the robots to fulfill reach-avoid tasks while maintaining certain formation constraints. The experiments show that GAMARA produces formally guaranteed feedback controllers while scaling to many robots. In contrast, nominal open-loop controllers do not guarantee the satisfaction of the specification, and global formal approaches run out of memory before synthesizing a controller.},

abstract = {The introduction of the Digital Twin (DT) has sparked a great deal of interest in the virtual replication of physical assets and processes. However, to fully realize the potential of DT, companies require robust and scalable front-end solutions. This study proposes harnessing micro-frontend technologies to surmount the limitations of monolithic front-end frameworks, thereby crafting effective presentation layers tailored for industrial companies. By decomposing complex and distributed systems into modular web-based DT, the proposed framework enables better scalability, synergy, and efficient application development. It also tackles the intricacies introduced by complex multi-vendor elements within DT and the orchestration of services and virtual environments. Research is focused on developing an architecture that facilitates seamless connectivity between multiple blocks of DT as well as interactivity and immersive experiences. Our study offers insights into our journey of implementing this framework for various industrial use cases, such as training, monitoring, and control, highlighting the benefits, drawbacks, and challenges. Ultimately, this research aims to accelerate the creation of DT, improve maintainability, and increase efficiency and productivity in industrial environments.},

models for complex systems where derivation from first principles is too difficult. In this paper, we study the
identification problem for switched dynamical systems with polynomial ODEs. This is a difficult problem as
it combines estimating coefficients for nonlinear dynamics and determining boundaries between modes. We
propose two different algorithms for this problem, depending on whether to perform prior segmentation of
trajectories. For methods with prior segmentation, we present a heuristic segmentation algorithm and a way to
classify themodes using clustering. Formethods without prior segmentation, we extend identification techniques
for piecewise affine models to our problem. To estimate derivatives along the given trajectories, we use Linear
MultistepMethods. Finally, we propose a way to evaluate an identified model by computing a relative difference
between the predicted and actual derivatives. Based on this evaluation method, we perform experiments on
five switched dynamical systems with different parameters, for a total of twenty cases. We also compare with
three baseline methods: clustering with DBSCAN, standard optimization methods in SciPy and identification of
ARX models in Matlab, as well as with state-of-the-art identification method for piecewise affine models. The
experiments show that our two methods perform better across a wide range of situations.},

In this paper, we investigate the cellular association trace synthesis (CATS) problem, aiming to generate diverse and realistic cellular association traces based on road segment-based trajectories and corresponding departure times. To substantiate our research, we first gather substantial data, including road segment-based trajectories, base station (BS) distribution, and ground truths of cellular association traces. We then perform systematic data analysis to reveal technical challenges such as disparity in geographic spaces, complex and dynamic BS handover, and poor performance of single-dimension approaches. To address these challenges, we propose SynthCAT, a novel scheme that fuses model-based and data-driven approaches. Specifically, SynthCAT includes: i) A model-based coarse-grained cellular association trace generation component, encompassing GPS reference generation, weighted historical average time generation, Bayesian decision, and time mapping modules. This component establishes a unified GPS space to map road and BS spaces, generates initial time information, synthesizes coarse-grained spatial cellular association traces by following explicit BS handover rules, and maps the corresponding arrival time for each trace point; ii) A fine-grained cellular association trace generation component, which combines model-based and data-driven approaches. This employs a two-stage Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network (AEGAN) to refine cellular association traces based on the coarse-grained ones. Extensive field experiments validate the efficacy of SynthCAT in terms of trace similarity to ground truths and its efficiency in supporting practical downstream applications.},

abstract = {Federated embedded systems (FES) is an approach for systems-of-systems engineering in the domain of cyber-physical systems. It is based on the idea to allow dynamic addition of plug-in software in the embedded system of a product, and through communication between the plug-ins in different products, it becomes possible to build services on the level of a federation of products. In this paper, architectural concerns for FES are elicited, and are used as rationale for a number of decisions in the architecture of products that are enabled for FES, as well as in the application architecture of a federation. A concrete implementation of a FES from the automotive domain is also described, as a validation of the architectural concepts presented.},

The main contribution of this paper is the development of a control barrier function based methodology which can be used to enforce set invariance on systems in the presence of non-linear disturbances and uncertainty. The first part of this work is a review of the current methods available for finding viable sets and how they are linked to practical choices regarding safety. Their limitations and directions towards improvements when it comes to handling model uncertainty are also highlighted. The second part of this work is the formulation of a condition which can guarantee set invariance in the presence of generic uncertain in the dynamics. An associated optimization problem to enforce that condition is proposed and a method to convexify the problem and make it solvable in real-time is formally presented. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated experimentally on a two-wheeled inverted pendulum.},

abstract = {Evaluation of industrial embedded control system designs is a time-consuming and imperfect process. While an ideal process would apply a formal verification technique such as model checking or theorem proving, these techniques do not scale to industrial design problems, and it is often difficult to use these techniques to verify performance aspects of control system designs, such as stability or convergence. For industrial designs, engineers rely on testing processes to identify critical or unexpected behaviors. We propose a novel framework called Underminer to improve the testing process; this is an automated technique to identify nonconverging behaviors in embedded control system designs. Underminer treats the system as a black box and lets the designer indicate the model parameters, inputs, and outputs that are of interest. It differentiates convergent from nonconvergent behaviors using Convergence Classifier Functions (CCFs).The tool can be applied in the context of testing models created late in the controller development stage, where it assumes that the given model displays mostly convergent behavior and learns a CCF in an unsupervised fashion from such convergent model behaviors. This CCF is then used to guide a thorough exploration of the model with the help of optimization-guided techniques or adaptive sampling techniques, with the goal of identifying rare nonconvergent model behaviors. Underminer can also be used early in the development stage, where models may have some significant nonconvergent behaviors. Here, the framework permits designers to indicate their mental model for convergence by labeling behaviors as convergent/nonconvergent and then constructs a CCF using a supervised learning technique. In this use case, the goal is to use the CCF to test an improved design for the model. Underminer supports a number of convergence-like notions, such as those based on Lyapunov analysis and temporal logic, and also CCFs learned directly from labeled output behaviors using machine-learning techniques such as support vector machines and neural networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of Underminer by evaluating its performance on several academic as well as industrial examples.},

abstract = {Healthcare applications on Voice Personal Assistant System (e.g., Amazon Alexa), have shown a great promise to deliver personalized health services via a conversational interface. However, concerns are also raised about privacy, safety, and service quality. In this paper, we propose VerHealth, to systematically assess health-related applications on Alexa for how well they comply with existing privacy and safety policies. VerHealth contains a static module and a dynamic module based on machine learning that can trigger and detect violation behaviors hidden deep in the interaction threads. We use VerHealth to analyze 813 health-related applications on Alexa by sending over 855,000 probing questions and analyzing 863,000 responses. We also consult with three medical school students (domain experts) to confirm and assess the potential violations. We show that violations are quite common, e.g., 86.36% of them miss disclaimers when providing medical information; 30.23% of them store user physical or mental health data without approval. Domain experts believe that the applications' medical suggestions are often factually-correct but are of poor relevance, and applications should have asked more questions before providing suggestions for over half of the cases. Finally, we use our results to discuss possible directions for improvements.},

abstract = {Interactive, distributed, and embedded systems often behave stochastically, for example, when inputs, message delays, or failures conform to a probability distribution. However, reasoning analytically about the behavior of complex stochastic systems is generally infeasible. While simulations of systems are commonly used in engineering practice, they have not traditionally been used to reason about formal specifications. Statistical model checking (SMC) addresses this weakness by using a simulation-based approach to reason about precise properties specified in a stochastic temporal logic. A specification for a communication system may state that within some time bound, the probability that the number of messages in a queue will be greater than 5 must be less than 0.01. Using SMC, executions of a stochastic system are first sampled, after which statistical techniques are applied to determine whether such a property holds. While the output of sample-based methods are not always correct, statistical inference can quantify the confidence in the result produced. In effect, SMC provides a more widely applicable and scalable alternative to analysis of properties of stochastic systems using numerical and symbolic methods. SMC techniques have been successfully applied to analyze systems with large state spaces in areas such as computer networking, security, and systems biology. In this article, we survey SMC algorithms, techniques, and tools, while emphasizing current limitations and tradeoffs between precision and scalability.},

abstract = {Geospatial data, specifically semantic 3D building data, plays a crucial role in urban energy analysis as spatial calculations using 3D geometries usually form the basis for energy simulation and modelling needed for numerous smart cities applications. Additional information describing the building stock, such as building materials and energetic properties but also data not directly linked to urban morphology such as weather data, environmental data, vegetation or socio-demographic data sets are required for these applications. A major drawback in the widespread applicability of urban energy analysis is the lack of available data sets as well as the costly and lengthy labor-intensive process of generation of those data sets (e.g. 3D city models or LIDAR data). While recent years have seen an opening up of urban data sets through free and open data portals, web services, and APIs that are used for urban energy analysis, data standardization and varying data quality still raises big challenges. This research explores different methodologies for the generation and usage of semantic 3D city models based on free and open data sources and software. In this paper, we describe four different methodologies for the generation of semantic 3D city models from available open data (geospatial data portals, LIDAR data, Open Street Map data, and remote sensing) and the tools required to achieve the task. To evaluate the suitability of these open-data sets for smart cities applications, multiple energy models, such as an energy performance model and a vertical solar radiation tool, previously developed in EIFER, have been applied to evaluate the applicability of these generated city models.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased the use of face masks across the world. Aside from physical distancing, they are among the most effective protection for healthcare workers and the general population. Face masks are passive devices, however, and cannot alert the user in case of improper fit or mask degradation. Additionally, face masks are optimally positioned to give unique insight into some personal health metrics. Recognizing this limitation and opportunity, we present FaceBit: an open-source research platform for smart face mask applications. FaceBit's design was informed by needfinding studies with a cohort of health professionals. Small and easily secured into any face mask, FaceBit is accompanied by a mobile application that provides a user interface and facilitates research. It monitors heart rate without skin contact via ballistocardiography, respiration rate via temperature changes, and mask-fit and wear time from pressure signals, all on-device with an energy-efficient runtime system. FaceBit can harvest energy from breathing, motion, or sunlight to supplement its tiny primary cell battery that alone delivers a battery lifetime of 11 days or more. FaceBit empowers the mobile computing community to jumpstart research in smart face mask sensing and inference, and provides a sustainable, convenient form factor for health management, applicable to COVID-19 frontline workers and beyond.},

abstract = {Networked cyber-physical systems are fundamentally constrained by the tight coupling and closed-loop control of physical processes. To address actuation in such closed-loop wireless control systems there is a strong need to rethink the communication architectures and protocols for reliability, coordination, and control. We introduce the Embedded Virtual Machine (EVM), a programming abstraction where controller tasks with their control and timing properties are maintained across physical node boundaries and functionality is capable of migrating to the most competent set of physical controllers. In the context of process and discrete control, an EVM is the distributed runtime system that dynamically selects primary-backup sets of controllers given spatial and temporal constraints of the underlying wireless network. EVM-based algorithms allow network control algorithms to operate seamlessly over less reliable wireless networks with topological changes. They introduce new capabilities such as predictable outcomes during sensor/actuator failure, adaptation to mode changes, and runtime optimization of resource consumption. An automated design flow from Simulink to platform-independent domain-specific languages, and subsequently, to platform-dependent code generation is presented. Through case studies in discrete and process control we demonstrate the capabilities of EVM-based wireless network control systems.},
