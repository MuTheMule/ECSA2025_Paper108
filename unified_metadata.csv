As pointed out by Sangiovanni-Vincentelli (The context for platform-based design.

The last term denotes software that provides an intermediate layer between the OS and application software. This chapter starts with a description of general requirements for embedded operating systems. This includes real-time capabilities as well as adaptation techniques to provide just the required functionality. Mutually exclusive access to resources can result in priority inversion, which is a serious problem for real-time systems. Priority inversion can be circumvented with resource access protocols. We will present three such protocols: the priority inheritance, priority ceiling, and stack resource protocols. A separate section covers the ERIKA real-time system kernel. Furthermore, we will explain how Linux can be adapted to systems with tight resource constraints. Finally, we will provide pointers for additional reusable software components, like hardware abstraction layers (HALs), communication software, and real-time data bases. Our description of embedded operating systems and of middleware in this chapter is consistent with the overall design flow.</jats:p>",,,CrossRef

The Interoperability Challenge: Building a Model-Driven Digital Thread Platform for CPS,"T. Margaria, Hafiz Ahmad Awais Chaudhary, I. Guevara, Stephen Ryan, Alexander Schieweck",2021.0,Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods,10.1007/978-3-030-89159-6_25,"With the heterogeneity of the industry 4.0 world, and more generally of the Cyberphysical Systems realm, the quest towards a platform approach to solve the interoperability problem is front and centre to any system and system-of-systems project. Traditional approaches cover individual aspects, like data exchange formats and published interfaces. They may adhere to some standard, however they hardly cover the production of the integration layer, which is implemented as bespoke glue code that is hard to produce and even harder to maintain. Therefore, the traditional integration approach often leads to poor code quality, further increasing the time and cost and reducing the agility, and a high reliance on the individual development skills. We are instead tackling the interoperability challenge by building a model driven/low-code Digital Thread platform that 1) systematizes the integration methodology, 2) provides methods and techniques for the individual integrations based on a layered Domain Specific Languages (DSL) approach, 3) through the DSLs it covers the integration space domain by domain, technology by technology, and is thus highly generalizable and reusable, 4) showcases a first collection of examples from the domains of robotics, IoT, data analytics, AI/ML and web applications, 5) brings cohesiveness to the aforementioned heterogeneous platform, and 6) is easier to understand and maintain, even by not specialized programmers. We showcase the power, versatility and the potential of the Digital Thread platform on four interoperability case studies: the generic extension to REST services, to robotics through the UR family of robots, to the integration of various external databases (for data integration) and to the provision of data analytics capabilities in R.",,14.0,Semantic Scholar

The workflow is modelled using the Vienna Development Method (VDM), conditional partial order graphs (CPOGs), and the basic Calculus of Communicating Systems for dynamic process reconfiguration (basic CCSdp), and verification of the reconfiguration requirements is attempted using the models.

models for complex systems where derivation from first principles is too difficult. In this paper, we study the
identification problem for switched dynamical systems with polynomial ODEs. This is a difficult problem as
it combines estimating coefficients for nonlinear dynamics and determining boundaries between modes. We
propose two different algorithms for this problem, depending on whether to perform prior segmentation of
trajectories. For methods with prior segmentation, we present a heuristic segmentation algorithm and a way to
classify themodes using clustering. Formethods without prior segmentation, we extend identification techniques
for piecewise affine models to our problem. To estimate derivatives along the given trajectories, we use Linear
MultistepMethods. Finally, we propose a way to evaluate an identified model by computing a relative difference
between the predicted and actual derivatives. Based on this evaluation method, we perform experiments on
five switched dynamical systems with different parameters, for a total of twenty cases. We also compare with
three baseline methods: clustering with DBSCAN, standard optimization methods in SciPy and identification of
ARX models in Matlab, as well as with state-of-the-art identification method for piecewise affine models. The
experiments show that our two methods perform better across a wide range of situations.","Linear multistep methods, Switched dynamical systems, Grey-box inference, Black-box inference, System identification",,ACM

Intelligent and behavioral-based detection of malware in IoT spectrum sensors,"A. Celdrán, P. Sánchez, Miguel Azorín Castillo, Gérôme Bovet, G. Pérez, B. Stiller",2022.0,International Journal of Information Security,10.1007/s10207-022-00602-w,"The number of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) available in industrial environments is growing mainly due to the evolution of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. In such a context, radio frequency spectrum sensing in industrial scenarios is one of the most interesting applications of CPS due to the scarcity of the spectrum. Despite the benefits of operational platforms, IoT spectrum sensors are vulnerable to heterogeneous malware. The usage of behavioral fingerprinting and machine learning has shown merit in detecting cyberattacks. Still, there exist challenges in terms of (i) designing, deploying, and evaluating ML-based fingerprinting solutions able to detect malware attacks affecting real IoT spectrum sensors, (ii) analyzing the suitability of kernel events to create stable and precise fingerprints of spectrum sensors, and (iii) detecting recent malware samples affecting real IoT spectrum sensors of crowdsensing platforms. Thus, this work presents a detection framework that applies device behavioral fingerprinting and machine learning to detect anomalies and classify different botnets, rootkits, backdoors, ransomware and cryptojackers affecting real IoT spectrum sensors. Kernel events from CPU, memory, network, file system, scheduler, drivers, and random number generation have been analyzed, selected, and monitored to create device behavioral fingerprints. During testing, an IoT spectrum sensor of the ElectroSense platform has been infected with ten recent malware samples (two botnets, three rootkits, three backdoors, one ransomware, and one cryptojacker) to measure the detection performance of the framework in two different network configurations. Both supervised and semi-supervised approaches provided promising results when detecting and classifying malicious behaviors from the eight previous malware and seven normal behaviors. In particular, the framework obtained 0.88–0.90 true positive rate when detecting the previous malicious behaviors as unseen or zero-day attacks and 0.94–0.96 F 1-score when classifying them.",,39.0,Semantic Scholar

We specifically aim for distributed and decentralized decision-making by spreading the control over several hierarchical layers. In addition, we propose a middleware layer to encapsulate units and services for time-critical operations in highly dynamic environments. We further enlist a multitude of vulnerabilities to cyberattacks, and integrate software-defined solutions for enabling resilience, detection and recovery.

IoTEF: A Federated Edge-Cloud Architecture for Fault-Tolerant IoT Applications,"Asad Javed, J. Robert, Keijo Heljanko, Kary Främling",2020.0,Journal of Grid Computing,10.1007/s10723-019-09498-8,"The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to an increased emphasis on edge computing for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), in which applications rely on processing data closer to the data sources, and sharing the results across heterogeneous clusters. This has simplified the data exchanges between IoT/CPS systems, the cloud, and the edge for managing low latency, minimal bandwidth, and fault-tolerant applications. Nonetheless, many of these applications administer data collection on the edge and offer data analytic and storage capabilities in the cloud. This raises the problem of separate software stacks between the edge and the cloud with no unified fault-tolerant management, hindering dynamic relocation of data processing. In such systems, the data must also be preserved from being corrupted or duplicated in the case of intermittent long-distance network connectivity issues, malicious harming of edge devices, or other hostile environments. Within this context, the contributions of this paper are threefold: (i) to propose a new Internet of Things Edge-Cloud Federation (IoTEF) architecture for multi-cluster IoT applications by adapting our earlier Cloud and Edge Fault-Tolerant IoT (CEFIoT) layered design. We address the fault tolerance issue by employing the Apache Kafka publish/subscribe platform as the unified data replication solution. We also deploy Kubernetes for fault-tolerant management, combined with the federated scheme, offering a single management interface and allowing automatic reconfiguration of the data processing pipeline, (ii) to formulate functional and non-functional requirements of our proposed solution by comparing several IoT architectures, and (iii) to implement a smart buildings use case of the ongoing Otaniemi3D project as proof-of-concept for assessing IoTEF capabilities. The experimental results conclude that the architecture minimizes latency, saves network bandwidth, and handles both hardware and network connectivity based failures.",,47.0,Semantic Scholar

We present findings from the playing a game designed and themed around interactions within the IoT whereby players are introduced to its underlying operations and data flows through the procedural rhetoric of the game. The data associated with IoT interactions is often invisible and/or unintelligible to the general user and we therefore use the rhetoric presented through playing the game to foreground the complexity of both seen and unseen activities within IoT augmented spaces.

A secure IoT and edge computing based EV selection model in V2G systems using ant colony optimization algorithm,"Gopinath Anjinappa, Divakar Bangalore Prabhakar",2022.0,International Journal of Pervasive Computing and Communications,10.1108/ijpcc-06-2022-0245,"
Purpose
The fluctuations that occurred between the power requirements have shown a higher range of voltage regulations and frequency. The fluctuations are caused because of substantial changes in the energy dissipation. The operational efficiency has been reduced when the power grid is enabled with the help of electric vehicles (EVs) that were created by the power resources. The model showed an active load matching for regulating the power and there occurred a harmonic motion in energy. The main purpose of the proposed research is to handle the energy sources for stabilization which has increased the reliability and improved the power efficiency. This study or paper aims to elaborate the security and privacy challenges present in the vehicle 2 grid (V2G) network and their impact with grid resilience.


Design/methodology/approach
The smart framework is proposed which works based on Internet of Things and edge computations that managed to perform an effective V2G operation. Thus, an optimum model for scheduling the charge is designed on each EV to maximize the number of users and selecting the best EV using the proposed ant colony optimization (ACO). At the first, the constructive phase of ACO where the ants in the colony generate the feasible solutions. The constructive phase with local search generates an ACO algorithm that uses the heterogeneous colony of ants and finds effectively the best-known solutions widely to overcome the problem.


Findings
The results obtained by the existing in-circuit serial programming-plug-in electric vehicles model in terms of power usage ranged from 0.94 to 0.96 kWh which was lower when compared to the proposed ACO that showed power usage of 0.995 to 0.939 kWh, respectively, with time. The results showed that the energy aware routed with ACO provided feasible routing solutions for the source node that provided the sensor network at its lifetime and security at the time of authentication.


Originality/value
The proposed ACO is aware of energy routing protocol that has been analyzed and compared with the energy utilization with respect to the sensor area network which uses power resources effectively.

Purpose
Internet has changed radically in the way people interact in the virtual world, in their careers or social relationships. IoT technology has added a new vision to this process by enabling connections between smart objects and humans, and also between smart objects themselves, which leads to anything, anytime, anywhere, and any media communications. IoT allows objects to physically see, hear, think, and perform tasks by making them talk to each other, share information and coordinate decisions. To enable the vision of IoT, it utilizes technologies such as ubiquitous computing, context awareness, RFID, WSN, embedded devices, CPS, communication technologies, and internet protocols. IoT is considered to be the future internet, which is significantly different from the Internet we use today. The purpose of this paper is to provide up-to-date literature on trends of IoT research which is driven by the need for convergence of several interdisciplinary technologies and new applications.


Design/methodology/approach
A comprehensive IoT literature review has been performed in this paper as a survey. The survey starts by providing an overview of IoT concepts, visions and evolutions. IoT architectures are also explored. Then, the most important components of IoT are discussed including a thorough discussion of IoT operating systems such as Tiny OS, Contiki OS, FreeRTOS, and RIOT. A review of IoT applications is also presented in this paper and finally, IoT challenges that can be recently encountered by researchers are introduced.


Findings
Studies of IoT literature and projects show the disproportionate importance of technology in IoT projects, which are often driven by technological interventions rather than innovation in the business model. There are a number of serious concerns about the dangers of IoT growth, particularly in the areas of privacy and security; hence, industry and government began addressing these concerns. At the end, what makes IoT exciting is that we do not yet know the exact use cases which would have the ability to significantly influence our lives.

Design of a Secure Password-Based Authentication Scheme for M2M Networks in IoT Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems,"K. Renuka, S. Kumari, Dongning Zhao, Li Li",2019.0,IEEE Access,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2908499,"The Internet of Things (IoT) forms a foundation for cyber-physical systems. We propose an efficient and secure authentication scheme for machine-to-machine (M2M) networks in IoT enabled cyber-physical systems. Smart objects and smart devices over CPS are capable of capturing a variety of multimedia contents; interact with each other and also with the physical world in a fully automatic manner without human interference. The proposed scheme allows any pair of entities in an M2M network to mutually authenticate each other and agree on a session key for communicating data in a secure and efficient way. The authentication process does not incorporate the M2M service provider, and hence eliminates the burden of managing the authentication of massive scale devices at the edge of the network. The burden of the authentication process is offloaded and distributed on the gateways under the authority of this M2M service provider. The proposed scheme requires the mobile user to hold only one secret key provided by the M2M service provider, by which, he can roam randomly in the M2M network and authenticate to any of the gateways in the domain. Then, this authenticated gateway allows the mobile user to authenticate with any sensor node in the domain. In the proposed scheme, the authentication process does not rely on any public key cryptographic operations. Authentication is achieved using very few hash invocations and symmetric key encryptions. Therefore, the scheme is suitable for environmental sensors which are limited in resources (computation, storage, and energy). We analyze the security of the proposed scheme using BAN logic, which is widely accepted as a framework for the assessment of authentication protocols and also using ProVerif. We assess the efficiency of the proposed scheme and compare with some recently proposed schemes.",,40.0,Semantic Scholar

The l-monitorability metric indicates the ability of a controller to monitor individual plant state variables with l different groups of functionally diverse outputs. Paired together, the metrics lead to CPS reaching (k,l)-resilience. When k and l are both greater than one, a CPS can absorb and adapt to control-theoretic attacks manipulating input and output signals.

Not only this, the enhancement of sensors has also laid the base of automation. However, the increased number of sensors make the IoT networks more complex and scaled. Due to the increasing size and complexity, IoT networks of scale-free nature are found highly prone to attacks. In order to maintain the functionality of crucial applications, it is mandatory to increase the robustness of IoT networks. Additionally, it has been found that scale-free networks are resistant to random attacks. However, they are highly vulnerable to intentional, malicious, deliberate, targeted and cyber attacks where nodes are destroyed based on preference. Moreover, sensors of IoT network have limited communication, processing and energy resources. Hence, they cannot bear the load of computationally extensive robustness algorithms. A communication model is proposed in this paper to save the sensors from computational overhead of robustness algorithms by migrating the computational load to back-end high power processing clusters.

Currently, data management and device interaction for IoT devices are centralized, with a central server managing the storage functions. As a novel data storage solution, blockchain technology offers security through its inherent features, such as distributivity, decentralization, immutability, and consensus mechanisms. Consensus mechanisms represents the rule set imposed by the blockchain network on the IoT devices to enhance network security. In this paper, we analyzed three types of consensus mechanisms - Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Authority - to determine which is best suited for use in IoT data storage solution that uses blockchain. Thus, we evaluated the consensus mechanisms on public blockchain test networks using three metrics: transaction latency, average block time, and average query time. Our obtained results show the PoS and PoA consensus mechanisms are more appropriate for IoT, exhibiting lower transaction latency, lower average block time and query time when compared to the PoW mechanism. This suggests that PoS and PoA are promising alternatives for blockchain-based IoT systems that require energy-efficient and low-latency transactions.",Blockchain;Consensus mechanisms;Internet of Things;Blockchain Testnets;Proof of Stake;Proof of Authority;Proof of Work,3.0,IEEE

Logistics and sustainment are traditionally brought into the IoT conversation through asset tracking, transportation, and Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS). However the IoT has additional aspects that can be related to logistics information systems and automated test. In relation to Automated Test Systems, the IoT can be a valuable component while an ATS may also use IoT concepts and capabilities within its own architecture. ATSs are applicable in all layers of the IoT: sensing, networking / communications, and applications. An ATS can be a sensor in the IoT serving to inform sustaining engineering, product support management, maintenance planning, and supply chain decisions through its test and diagnostic data. In addition, many ATSs consist of a network of instrumentation and measurement devices that can serve as part of the IoT network / communication layer. And finally an automated test and diagnostic application can be used in the IoT to expand the scale of testing beyond standard automated test capability. This paper describes and analyzes the implementation of Automated Test Systems in all three IoT layers. The described ATS / IoT interactions elicit multiple benefits and challenges. The ubiquity and diversity of sensors in the Internet of Things allows for a new scope of testing across an enterprise, correlation of asset usage and repair, supply chain prognostics, and opportunities for deep learning. Challenges inevitably include cybersecurity and the analysis of overwhelming data.

Traditional centralized approaches to identity management face challenges of security, scalability, and privacy. Therefore, the paper provides an innovative approach by fusing Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) with blockchain technology to revolutionize device identity management within CPS environments. In this paper, devices autonomously initiate their identity-creation processes. Each device generates a cryptographic key pair comprising a public key for openly identifying the device and a closely guarded private key used for authentication and decryption purposes. The research also introduces an innovative authentication algorithm within CPS environments that employs secure tokens to validate the authenticity of devices. The proposed framework reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches while empowering devices with control over their identities. Overall, the proposed approach not only enhances security, privacy, and resilience within CPSs but also provides a transformative solution for identity management in dynamic and autonomous device environments.",Cyber-Physical Systems;Internet of Things;Blockchain;Cryptography;Self-Sovereign Identity;Data Security,4.0,"IEEE, Semantic Scholar"

In a Fog computing network, the network topology is dynamic. New nodes will join and leave. One of the major issues in Fog computing is trust. Trust is the level of assurance that an object will behave in a satisfactory manner. The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a protocol used for routing in IoT networks. RPL provides meager protection against routing or other forms of attacks. The resource-constrained nature of Fog nodes prevents the use of heavyweight cryptographic algorithms to achieve secured communication. A lightweight mechanism is thus essential to impart security in Fog-IoT networks. Trust analysis provides a behavior-based analysis of entities in the system with the power to predict future behavior.

In CPS, the real world and the computing systems are connected through networks with real-time information exchange. The introduction of networking technologies in CPS has substantial advantages in terms of system efficiency, scalability, maintenance, and many more. However, CPS are vulnerable to malicious attackers intruding on the network. The attackers aim to destroy the physical systems with cyber-physical attacks, in which the main objective is to remotely cause malfunctions in physical systems through networks. Therefore, extensive research on cyber-physical security has been conducted to detect cyber-physical attacks and guarantee the stability of the physical systems under cyber-physical attacks. In this survey, we conduct an exhaustive review of the literature on threats to CPS and on resilient CPS design strategies. First, we discuss the structure of CPS, considering physical dynamics, computing systems, and networks. Then, we provide a taxonomy of cyber-physical attacks with three properties (attack space, attack location, and stealthiness). These three attributes represent the requirements for the implementation of cyber-physical attacks. We review existing studies on anomaly-detection strategies against cyber-physical attacks in terms of physics, networks, and machine learning techniques. Moreover, we analyze the impact of typical cyber-physical attacks and the constraints on attack implementations. In particular, for each of the well-established cyber-physical attacks, we present numerical examples that clearly illustrate the time responses of the physical systems with a conventional physics-based anomaly detector. We also review advances in the typical cyber-physical attacks and the detection methods for these attacks. Furthermore, we review resilient CPS designs in the context of control theory, network management, and data-driven technologies.

In essence, blockchain supports a decentralized platform maintained by peers instead of a single entity. Furthermore, the data in the blockchain is immutable and is being held in a secure and encrypted way. However, running the blockchain on resource-limited devices, such as a consumer PC or a low-power Raspberry Pi as opposed to dedicated servers, is demanding due to the resource limitation in energy, memory, and time taken to validate the transaction on the blockchain. This paper explores these limitations by evaluating and benchmarking the blockchain framework Geth: a terminal interface for the Ethereum blockchain which makes it possible to create a private blockchain in addition to joining the actual blockchain. This article employs a private blockchain within Geth and benchmarks the blockchain to highlight the differences (and limitations) between the devices. Specifically, we make the following observations: (i) the time it takes to validate and add the transaction to the blockchain on a Raspberry Pi 4 is markedly slower compared to an Intel i9-10885H CPU @ 2.40GHz, (ii) the transaction between PCs compared to transactions between Pis is around two orders of magnitude higher.

The wireless sensors relay their packets on to the base station via multi-hop transmissions and the overall functioning of the system, therefore, is dependent on these intermediate nodes. However, unbalanced data forward amongst the nodes results in high-energy consumption and packets drop. The network lifetime and link reliability are the most important factors for the network to work for longer period of time, hence optimum selection of the paths for packet routing is key for prolonged network life. This paper proposes a link quality-oriented route (LQOR) protocol for scalable IoT networks. The main goal of this scheme is to balance the network load by intelligently selecting the next hop with less number of neighbouring nodes. The comparative performance evaluation corroborates the positive impact of the algorithm as compared to other related techniques existing in the literature.

Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SystemC-AMS through use cases that simulate grid-following inverters.

At present, State Grid has deployed the Huawei IoT management platform to realize the standardized collection of data. However, the current IOTs management platform only realizes the access of MQTT protocol, and lacks the unified management capability for multi-source heterogeneous terminals. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel architecture design of power IoTs architecture. Focusing on the southbound device access and northbound device management of the IoTs management platform, a protocol analysis cloud gateway and a unified cloud edge collaboration architecture are proposed. In order to solve the problem of multi-protocol access, the protocol analysis cloud gateway deploys the parsing program in the form of plug-in in the protocol plug-in layer, which can be flexibly extended for new protocols. Aiming at the problem of device management, this paper proposes a unified cloud edge collaboration architecture, enhances the capabilities of remote management for application and container based on the northbound API interface of Huawei IoTs management platform, and proposes a method compatible with different edge computing frameworks on the edge side.

To enhance the resilience of a distribution system during extreme disasters, a method that considers cyber-physical interdependence has been explored. Firstly, the missing area was identified as an evaluation index of distribution system resilience. The difference in resilience between the two states of communication, normal and faulty, was defined as the impact of a faulty cyber subsystem on a power distribution system. Then, the cyber-physical interdependence was modelled as a mixed integer linear model based on network flow theory. Thirdly, the three recovery measures of priority restoration of power subsystems, priority restoration of cyber subsystems, and cyber-physical coordinated recovery are compared to obtain the optimal recovery strategy.

Resilience of Cyber-Physical System: A Case Study of Safe School Environment,J. Rajamäki; P. Rathod; A. Ahlgren; J. Aho; M. Takari; S. Ahlgren,2012,2012 European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference,10.1109/EISIC.2012.10,"Modern critical infrastructure includes a combination of computational and physical components, known as cyber-physical system (CPS). Often, urban built infrastructures represent a critical node within the intertwined networks of an urban area. Current school environment are examples of Cuss including automatic access controls (AACs), guidance and alarm systems (GASs), digital clocks, heat and motion identification sensors, and remolding spaces such as classrooms. A safe school environment can be created using parallel methods such as preventive, proactive and readiness for reactive resilience. Espoo City is constructing a new school campus Opinmäki and Laurea University of Applied Sciences acts as a safety and security consultant within the project. This paper focuses on needs for improved understanding of school security solutions, mainly covering readiness for reactive methods of security. The paper presents two technical security solutions: 1) technical control and reporting emergency incident and 2) design of security room. AAC tags can be identification cards, wristbands, necklaces, and others. The person who has a tag can be identified. These persons can be teachers, staff, students or someone who need access. This solution allows an access in building facilities to only identified authorize people. Students can move around without tags during the day in the public area that is not locked, like most of the classrooms or they have identification cards to get access to labs and other facilities. Children in the daycare wear a special wristband that helps identifying them, enhancing cost savings with automating routine operations. The heat and air conditioning systems can automatically set correct working level when system identifies a number of people in the building. AAC is linked to video surveillance working in public areas and entrances. Video surveillance being used for two purposes: 1) in crisis situations recordings can be explored and hand over to the police, 2) to count the number of people in the variable areas. Normally classes are not monitored as teachers have control on accessing student spaces. However, there can be provision of class monitoring on major events or bigger classes. During off-hours, all the safety measures are active, and all persons should have their identification cards and all movements in school will be registered in the system. Doors cannot be opened when the video surveillance system detects more than one person tries to enter in 'only one person' at a time entrance. Analyzing software counts the number of people that enter or leave the area. Camera must be positioned almost perpendicular on top of the doorway. Another option is to install thermal cameras in every room, to count the exact number of people in a room. This technology does not reveal the identity of people in the room, hence nobody's privacy will be compromised. The school has heat and movement sensors installed in every room's roof structures. Sensors can identify the number of people in every room. Digital clocks being used for dual capabilities exist in all rooms. In the normal situation, they display time, but within problematic situation they show the alarm code. Alarms can be set automatically or manually. Manual setting has addition feature of identifying problematic space. The alarm shows various codes for alerting people to hide or leave the room, also alerts about required help in the space. The alarm is displayed in all spaces, classrooms and corridors of the problem situation. The alarm system can be monitored and controlled from the safety room and from each teacher's desk using touch-screen computer. The system can be used also by the specific application that is installed to a laptop computer and mobile phones. The software will be planned as simple and user friendly. Security aspects must be taken in to account when designing the software. There must be specialized security applications to ensure a safe and automatic control of the school. Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is used when checking the information security management process when designing the software. In imminent threats, teachers press the alarm button under the table. This kind of alarm will be activated immediately. In emergencies, use of the exit is controlled by emergency escape lighting technology and voice control. The school should build in such a way that it is easy to exit compare to entering access. Leaving from indoors must be easy and accessible. There are addition benefits of lighting technology including alerting, escorting and rescuing from dangers. Another part of the technical monitoring is a security room concept. The room should be very safe in emergencies, and you can monitor and control security from there. The security room can be accessed and reached only by limited staff members such as set teachers and the janitor. It is protected using layered security so that staff can work and control any dangers without any fear. The security room also functions as the control center for surveillance and live stream cameras in real-time security measures. The security room can be useful for many other security controls like door locks, access controls and treatment area.",Cyber-physical system;Public safety;Resilience of build infrastructures;Safety and security;School security,8.0,IEEE

The major concern in WSN is the limited battery power, which can be overcome by selecting the effective cluster head (CH) for the transmission of data in the network. In this paper, an entropy weighted-based I-LEACH protocol is developed for the selection of the CH. The proposed entropy weighted-based I-LEACH protocol is developed by modifying the standard LEACH protocol with the entropy weight. Initially, the IoT nodes are grouped together to form clusters, which is followed by the selection of the cluster head (CH) for the transmission of the data packets to the base station (BS). The CH is selected depending on the threshold value, which is based on the entropy function. The performance metrics, such as number of alive nodes and energy is used for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed entropy weighted-based (EWB) I-LEACH protocol. The proposed EWB I-LEACH protocol obtained a maximal alive nodes of 11 and maximal energy of 0.1138 J for 50 nodes under dual-slop channel model and obtained a maximal alive nodes of 9 and maximal energy of 0.1116 J for 50 nodes by considering log normal shadowing channel model when compared to the existing protocols.",Wireless Sensor Network;Internet of Things;routing;data transmission;sensor nodes,1.0,IEEE

In this paper, we propose a CJ scheme for IoT systems to fight against multiple passive and collusive eavesdroppers of unknown channel state information. Considering nodes with multi-antenna in an IoT system, we design beamforming vectors to maximize signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the wireless link from a controller (transmitter) to an actuator (receiver). Under the worst-case assumption that eavesdroppers can aggregate all signals to enhance their eavesdropping abilities, we derive the closed- form expressions of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) with and without CJ. In addition, we employ a strict mathematical asymptotic analysis to provide insights into the effects of various system parameters on the SOP. Numerical results verify that the CJ scheme can effectively prevent eavesdropping and the effects of system parameters on SOP is consistent with theoretical analytical results.",,6.0,IEEE

However, s-health records (SHRs) outsourcing, storage, and sharing via a cloud server must be protected and users attribute privacy issues from the public domain. Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is the cryptographic primitive which is promising to provide fine-grained access control in the cloud environment. However, the direct application of traditional CP-ABE has brought a lot of security issues like attributes' privacy violations and vulnerability in the future by potential powerful attackers like side-channel and cold-bot attacks. To solve these problems, a lot of CP-ABE schemes have been proposed but none of them concurrently support partially policy-hidden and leakage resilience. Hence, we propose a new Smart Health Records Sharing Scheme that will be based on Partially Policy-Hidden CP-ABE with Leakage Resilience which is resilient to bound leakage from each of many secret keys per user, as well as many master keys, and ensure attribute privacy. Our scheme hides attribute values of users in both secret key and ciphertext which contain sensitive information in the cloud environment and are fully secure in the standard model under the static assumptions.",,1.0,Semantic Scholar
An SDN-based Network Architecture for Internet of Things,Z. Zhang; R. Wang; X. Cai; Z. Jia,2018,2018 IEEE 20th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 16th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 4th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00162,"The exponential growth of devices connected to the network has resulted in the development of new IoT applications and services. A large number of IoT devices are application-specific which makes the network difficult to manage and change. The Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm brings a new perspective of solving the network rigidity issue. By introducing the OpenFlow protocol to the IoT network, the routing decisions can be translated into matching rules and actions in a programmable way, thus simplifying the network configuration and management. However, different from the wired domain, which uses a separate dedicated network for OpenFlow channel, the IoT devices have to communicate with the Controller in a multi-hop way. Since some IoT nodes are unstable due to the limited energy, environment or other factors, the multi-hop way results in an unstable control channel, which degrades the network performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a practical SDN-based network architecture for Internet of things. We propose an Optimal Control Channel (OCC) policy to select minimum number of nodes to establish a stable OpenFlow channel to reduce the performance loss caused by unstable IoT nodes. OCC establishes a stable control channel to bridge the IoT nodes and the Controller. Meanwhile, OCC is responsible for the control messages aggregation to further decrease the SDN-inherent control overheads. The experimental results show our architecture outperforms the original SDN-based scheme in terms of control overheads.",Internet of Things;SDN;Control Overhead;Optimal Control Channel,1.0,IEEE

Paul,2019,2019 IEEE 5th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),10.1109/ICCC47050.2019.9064242,"Internet of Things (IoT) is an evolving research area for the last two decades. The integration of the IoT and social networking concept results in developing an interdisciplinary research area called the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). The SIoT is dominant over the traditional IoT because of its structure, implementation, and operational manageability. In the SIoT, devices interact with each other independently to establish a social relationship for collective goals. To establish trustworthy relationships among the devices significantly improves the interaction in the SIoT and mitigates the phenomenon of risk. The problem is to choose a trustworthy node who is most suitable according to the choice parameters of the node. The best-selected node by one node is not necessarily the most suitable node for other nodes, as the trustworthiness of the node is independent for everyone. We employ some theoretical characterization of the soft-set theory to deal with this kind of decision-making problem. In this paper, we developed a weighted based trustworthiness ranking model by using soft set theory to evaluate the trustworthiness in the SIoT. The purpose of the proposed research is to reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions by identifying the most trusted nodes.",internet of things;trust;social internet of things;soft set theory;trust decision making,12.0,IEEE

This paper lays forth a thorough plan to improve cyber-physical security by bolstering intrusion detection systems (IDS) with the use of digital twin technology (DTT). Virtual representations of physical systems, or ""digital twins,"" allow for sophisticated modelling, predictive analytics, and real-time monitoring. Incorporating DTT with IDS allows for proactive and dynamic threat detection and response in this system. Datasets generated by an ICS testbed— a device designed to monitor storage reservoir water levels and turbulence—form the basis of the suggested architecture. The SCADA system uses a number of indicators to assess the efficacy of several machine learning (ML) models that are used to detect and categorize intrusions. The findings show that ML approaches are great at detecting intrusions, with low false positive rates and high detection rates. Also, the IDS can now identify more complex and unique assaults because to DTT's incorporation, which enables continuous system learning and adaptability. An important step forward in cyber-physical security, this research shows that digital twins have the ability to change intrusion detection systems (IDS) from reactive to proactive. The framework offers a durable and scalable approach to safeguard vital infrastructures from ever-changing cyber threats, and its ramifications reach into a wide range of industrial applications. The integration of Digital Twin Technology (DTT) with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for cyber-physical security showed significant improvements in threat detection. Test results revealed a 40% increase in early intrusion detection accuracy compared to traditional IDS models. Additionally, proactive system adaptations through DTT reduced response time to potential threats by 25%, enhancing overall system resilience",internet of things (IoT);automatic device communication;industrial control systems (ICS);intrusion detection systems,,IEEE

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multi-layer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ""edge router"" incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices.

But this connectedness also leads to more challenges in data security and the increased risk of cyber-attacks. Improved, and faster, security schemes have become a key requirement of these loT technologies. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been used to accelerate various cyber-security algorithms. However, while FPGAs are capable of massive computational power, through their highly parallel nature, they are generally difficult to program; and considering the design of modern encryption schemes this is posing a significant bottleneck to progress in security for these architectures. This paper investigates the use of a Python-based high-level FPGA design tool-flow for rapid prototyping of loT cryptosystems. In this paper we implement a version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, with block and key sizes of 128bits, using the Python-based tool-flow. The design is functionally verified, a Verilog hardware implementation is generated, simulated and then executed on an FPGA platform. The performance of the resulting FPGA design is analyzed in terms of resource utilization and throughput, and is compared against similar hand-written AES implementations reported in the literature.

However, Internet of Things development is hindered by the lack of standardized development guidance and learning resources. Moreover, the use of centralized IoT solutions introduces a single point of failure as well as exposes private data to a third-party, and may leads to data and privacy breach. This research proposes a decentralized IoT platform based on Kademlia protocol. This platform aims to ease the development of simple Internet of Things system as well as solving centralized system potential threats, such as single point of failure and data breach. The main concept of the platform is to establish an overlay network in which every member (node) in the network is able to access certain data stream available in the network. Every time a node receives a data stream from a data source, it replicates the data stream to some other node based on Kademlia, so the data stream is accessible to most member of the network. The platform can also perform as a simple API server for data stream for a stand-alone deployment. The platform, named Cadfort, is successfully developed and is able to support simple IoT API development. The publish and subscribe functionality is also working to some degree, in which it is able to lookup certain data keys successfully in a network sized less than 1000 nodes. However, on a network sized 1000 node or more, the node sometimes fails to find certain data keys, in which the success rate is around 80% in a network with 3000 nodes. The result shows that the platform is effective for moderately sized clusters up to 1000 nodes.",Internet of Things;decentralized;peer to peer;kademlia;overlay network,2.0,IEEE

Gradient-based Reconfiguration of Cyber-Physical Production Systems,K. Balzereit; O.

Even though CPPS have many possibilities to adapt to faults like using an alternative path or redundant hardware, the full potential is not exploited: Nowadays, the control software of CPPS is static and not able to adapt to unforeseen situations like an unknown fault. Hence, CPPS are not able to adapt to faults but a machine operator needs to reconfigure the system manually. Reconfiguration is the task of recovering valid system behavior after a fault has occurred. To enable CPPS to adapt autonomously to faults, automated reconfiguration is necessary. But since CPPS usually are dynamic systems consisting of interconnections of various components, identifying the necessary changes for reconfiguration is challenging: The effects of changes may only manifest after some time and lead to deviations in components far away from their root. This paper presents an approach on automated reconfiguration for CPPS, i.e. the automated recovery from faults. The approach is based on the usage of a logical calculus that reasons about the consequences of a fault and the possible adaptions. Therefore, the system is modeled in terms of logic. Gradient information is integrated to capture the system dynamics. The applicability of the algorithm is shown using a benchmark system from process engineering.

Further, we show that the order of operations within a reconfiguration sequence can be optimized using the blocking time as objective function. An evaluation on two example systems shows that our model allows the application of common schedulability tests for Rate Monotonic scheduling. In our examples, the optimization reduces the blocking time of a task during reconfiguration compared to a heuristic topological ordering by up to 85%. This makes previously infeasible reconfigurations feasible. The results imply that timing analysis of dynamic reconfiguration for component-based real-time systems is attainable, and further research is necessary to extend it for distributed systems.",Downtimeless System Evolution;Dynamic Soft-ware Updating;Dynamic Reconfiguration;Timing Analysis,6.0,IEEE

Most of the recent works for threat identification rely on supervised machine learning techniques which involve training a model using datasets containing labeled samples of prior attacks. A supervised network can thus only understand the categories on which it has been trained. Due to the enormous volume and variety of data collected by the IoT devices, and the attacks to which the networks are prone, the supervised techniques are of limited use in practical applications.

These physical objects after getting connected to the Internet can provide smart services and are therefore known as smart objects. For the realization of IoT, it is necessary for the smart objects to discover and interact each other without human intervention. The number of smart objects connected to IoT are increasing at a rapid rate, creating an overhead for the users of controlling these many smart objects. One smart solution to this problem is the use of Context-Aware Communication. This work aims to propose Enhanced Context-Aware CoAP Extension for smart objects discovery in Internet of Things (IoT), namely ECTX-CoAP, which is enhancement of CoAP-CTX [2]. CoAP-CTX is able to do Context-Aware discovery of smart objects but at the cost of discovery response time. The enhancement to CoAP-CTX is made by first, reducing discovery response time, comparable to CoAP and second, by adding the concept of Group Communication functionality to it other than multi-casting. The proposed ECTX-CoAP is implemented in Contiki using Cooja simulator.

In other words, some modes provide high security levels at the expense of high power consumption and other modes provide low power consumption with low security level. Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) is utilized to adaptively configure the hardware security module based on the available power budget. For example, for a given power constraint, the DPR controller configures the security module with the security mode that meets the available power constraint.

Belief Propagation and H-infinity Controller for Microgrid State Estimation and Stabilization Using Internet of Things Technologies,M. M. Rana; R. Bo,2019,2019 IEEE Innovative Smart Grid Technologies - Asia (ISGT Asia),10.1109/ISGT-Asia.2019.8881623,"Due to the global warming and increasing of green house gas emissions, the renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) are going to be integrated into the smart grid. As the grid can spread the intelligent energy management system to the long-distance remote areas, thus it requires a real-time dynamic state estimation and stabilization algorithm for monitoring and maintaining stability of these intermittent DERs. This paper proposes a belief propagation algorithm and H-infinity controller for system state estimation and stabilization using the internet of things (IoT) communication network. Basically, the IoT based smart sensors are deployed to gather the measurement information where the binary phase shift-keying are used for modulation. The system state and it error covariance are propagated between root and leave nodes of the considered Bayesian tree network. Using forward and backward propagation of the these variables, an accurate state estimation is obtained. Using Parseval's theorem, bounded real lemma and Schur's complement, the discrete-time H-infinity controller is designed. The numerical simulation results demonstrates that the algorithms can effectively estimate and stabilize the microgrid states.",Belief propagation;distributed energy resources;dynamic state estimation;H∞ controller;Internet of Things (IoT);microgrid,,IEEE

Most of today,s machines, e.g., automotive engines, production machinery or even consumer devices, such as a washing machine, are controlled by an embedded computer system. It is assumed that the widespread integration of these existing embedded computer systems and data bases into systems-ofsystems (e.g., the Internet of Things, IoT) will provide new synergistic services, make better use of the available information, lead to new insights, improve current economic processes and thus create greater wealth. Fueled by the dramatic technological progress in the area of wire-bound and wire-less communication, this integration is already happening on a wide scale in industry. From the viewpoint of computer science, the domain of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) is a relatively new field that poses significant new research challenges. In our view, the differentiating characteristics of a SoS compared to a monolithic system are the autonomy of the Constituent Systems (CS), emergent phenomena at the SoS level, uncoordinated evolution of the CSs and most, importantly, that the occurrence of faults in the CSs must be considered normal during the operation an SoS.

The issue of spectrum utilization is solved by cognitive radio (CR) network, a low-cost solution to utilize the spectrum efficiently. In CR networks the underutilized licensed spectrum is exploited by unlicensed users opportunistically. Due to their opportunistic nature, the performance of these networks depends on the observed spectrum pattern of a primary user. Therefore, perfect modeling of the spectrum detection and utilization is required in these networks. In this paper, we propose a primary user detection model for Cognitive Radio based Internet of Things (CR-IoT) using the hidden Markov model.

A fusion-based defense mechanism is proposed to mitigate the damage caused by such attacks, where each node feedbacks minimum (one-bit) local decision to the fusion center for attack inference.

Policy-Based Secure and Trustworthy Sensing for Internet of Things in Smart Cities,W. Li; H. Song; F. Zeng,2018,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2017.2720635,"The Internet of Things (IoT), which is known as one of the key enabling technologies of smart cities, generally refers to the network of smart objects, which are embedded with sensing, computing, networking, and actuating capabilities that all together enable them to collect and exchange data. The IoT devices are usually wirelessly networked, and they serve as a key enabling technology for many critical smart city applications, such as intelligent transportation, smart grid, smart building, and mobile healthcare. However, security has become a key challenge for the wide deployment of IoT: because of the environmental influences, the IoT data are inherently noisy. Moreover, the IoT devices may be compromised by attackers to intentionally generate fake data. Finally, the underlying wireless network can also be subverted. To address the security issue in IoT, we propose a policy-based secure and trustworthy sensing scheme for IoT named RealAlert, in which the trustworthiness of both data and the IoT devices are evaluated based on both the reporting history and the context in which the data are collected using policy rules.

Many architectural limitations, such as weak security, data distribution efficiency, provenance and traceability of sources, excessive human intervention, lack of interoperability, and service-awareness in devices configuration, have been exposed and called the society attention. This paper addresses these limitations by properly integrating five strategies: 1) efficient IoT data exchanging, storage and processing via information-centric networking (ICN); 2) contract-based IoT services composition; 3) software-control/management of IoT devices accordingly to the services requirements; 4) naming and name resolution of the physical and virtual entities, proving identifier/locator splitting and contextualized self-organization; and 5) name-based routing and network caching. Considering the current state-of-the art, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: proposal of a novel service-defined architecture (SDA), in which device configurations are a reflex of the real service needs (given by established contracts); combination of ICN benefits with named-services; and perennial identification of IoT devices, services, and data using self-verifiable naming. All integration work has been supported by a convergent architecture called NovaGenesis (NG), demonstrating its viability as an alternative for the current IoT architectures. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented in laboratory under real conditions. The experimental results indicate competitive performance in terms of data transfer, memory and CPU consumption. Embedded NG has smaller RAM and ROM requirements when compared to a similar RPL + 6LowPAN stack.

In this paper, we consider application partitioning and collaborative computation offloading in IoT networks, in order to meet the completion deadline of the applications while minimizing the overall energy consumption.

Finally, a maximum differential energy matching (MDEM) algorithm is devised by relaxing the network stability requirement, which can further benefit the energy efficiency for all network nodes.

The explosive growth of mobile users and IoT applications injects massive traffic to the IoT network and also speeds up the drainage of sensor batteries. Caching at the IoT gateway (GW), which stores the IoT data and directly send them to the users, can avoid activating sensors too frequently, hence reducing the traffic in the IoT network as well as the energy consumption of sensors. To overcome the limited energy capacity of sensors, energy transmitters (ETs) are deployed to charge them. Practically, the GW and ETs may be owned by different operators, and the GW operator needs to incentivize ETs to provision the charging service.

The limited computation and communication capacity of the cloud necessitate the edge computing, i.e., starting the IoT data processing at the edge and transforming the connected devices to intelligent devices. Machine learning (ML) the key means for information inference, should extend to the cloud-to-things continuum too. This paper reviews the role of ML in IoT from the cloud down to embedded devices. Different usages of ML for application data processing and management tasks are studied. The state-of-the-art usages of ML in IoT are categorized according to their application domain, input data type, exploited ML techniques, and where they belong in the cloud-to-things continuum.

The positive benefits of IIoT are increasing the demand for devices, but without proper security design foundations, CIs may be open to many different attack vectors. This lack of IIoT device security standards is a major concern. Due to the nature of these infrastructures and impact of compromises, CI device security is an utmost concern and must be focused on during all phases of development and manufacturing as opposed to the addition of security after functional design as seen with many current Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Many of these sensors and devices have limited resources, such as low power consumption, reduced memory storage, and reduced fixed-point processing capabilities. Traditional security protocols and solutions are often not practical on these restrained devices, and there are no current standards for characterizing device security. This paper presents a candidate security level-based architecture for low power IoT-CI devices implementing modular, low power, security primitives that are shown through simulation models and embedded software implementation to create a robustly layered defense-in-depth IoT architecture.

Distributed Learning for Low Latency Machine Type Communication in a Massive Internet of Things,T. Park; W.

Designing resource allocation schemes to support such coexistent, heterogeneous communication is hence a key IoT challenge. In particular, there is a need for self-organizing resource allocation solutions that can account for unique IoT features, such as massive scale and stringent resource constraints. In this paper, a novel finite memory multistate sequential learning framework is proposed to enable diverse IoT devices to share limited communication resources, while transmitting both delay-tolerant, periodic messages and urgent, critical messages. The proposed learning framework enables the IoT devices to learn the number of critical messages and to reallocate the communication resources for the periodic messages to be used for the critical messages. Furthermore, the proposed learning framework explicitly accounts for IoT device limitations in terms of memory and computational capabilities. The convergence of the proposed learning framework is proved, and the lowest expected delay that the IoT devices can achieve using this learning framework is derived. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm in IoT networks with different delay targets, network densities, probabilities of detection, and memory sizes is analyzed in terms of the probability of a successful random access (RA) request and percentage of devices that learned correctly. Simulation results show that, for a delay threshold of 1.25 ms, the average achieved delay is 0.71 ms and the delay threshold is satisfied with probability 0.87. Moreover, for a massive network, a delay threshold of 2.5 ms is satisfied with probability 0.92. The results also show that the proposed learning algorithm is very effective in reducing the delay of urgent, critical messages by intelligently reallocating the communication resources allocated to the delay-tolerant, periodic messages.",Finite memory learning;Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning;multistate learning,39.0,IEEE

CR is a form of wireless communication whereby a radio is dynamically programmed and configured to detect available spectrum channels. This enhances the spectrum utilization efficiency of radio frequency while avoiding interference and overcrowding to other users. Energy efficiency in CR-IoT network must be carefully formulated since the sensor nodes consume significant energy to support CR operations, such as in dynamic spectrum sensing and switching.

Resilience of IoT Systems Against Edge-Induced Cascade-of-Failures: A Networking Perspective,J. Wang; S. Pambudi; W. Wang; M. Song,2019,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2019.2913140,"Internet of Things (IoT) is a networking paradigm that interconnects physical systems to the cyber world, to provide automation and intelligence via interdependent links between the two domains. Such interdependence renders IoT systems vulnerable to random failures, e.g., broken communication links or crashed cyber instances, because a single incident in one domain can develop into a cascade-of-failures across domains, which dissolves the network structure, and has devastating consequences. To answer how robust an IoT system is, this paper studies its resilience by examining the impact of edge- and jointly-induced cascades, that is, a sequence of failures caused by randomly broken physical links (and simultaneous failing cyber nodes). Resilience of an IoT system is quantified by two new metrics, the critical edge disconnecting probability  $\phi _{cr}$ , i.e., the maximum intensity of random failures the system can withstand, and the cascade length  $\tau _{cf}$ , i.e., the lifetime of a cascade. For IoT systems with Poisson degree distributions, we derive exact solutions for the critical disconnecting probability  $\phi _{cr}$ , above which an edge-induced cascade will completely fragment the network. We also find that the critical condition  $\phi _{cr}$  marks a dichotomy of the expected cascade length  $\mathbb {E}(\tau _{cf})$ : for the super-critical ( $\phi > \phi _{cr}$ ) scenario, we obtain  $\mathbb {E}(\tau _{cf}) \sim \exp (1-\phi)$  through analysis, while for the subcritical scenario, we observe  $\mathbb {E}(\tau _{cf}) \sim \exp (1/1-\phi)$  through simulations. With these results, the final outcome of a cascade can be anticipated upon the initial failures, while the reaction window of time-sensitive countermeasures can be obtained before a cascade fully unfolds.",Interdependent networks;Internet of Things (IoT) architecture;network resilience,22.0,IEEE

However, these devices also come with new and advanced threats such as targeted ransomware. In this paper, we investigate this threat in detail. We studied the threat actors' motivations, the anatomy of ransomware for edge gateways, and the likelihood of such ransomware attack to happen in the future. We found that threat actors find IIoT edge gateways attractive ransomware targets due to their vital roles and functionalities in working with critical infrastructure and that the likelihood of such attack to occur is high. We built the first version of a ransomware security testbed for IIoT, and for test purposes, we developed a first version of ransomware target at IIoT edge gateway in a brownfield system. From our measurements we conclude that kernel-related activity parameters are significant indicators of the abnormal behavior caused by crypto-ransomware attacks in IIoT edge gateways, much more so even than for similar attacks in information technology server workstation.

Although the consumer IoT enables users to control many devices and offers conveniences and benefits for daily life, its long-term operation capabilities are subject to a bottleneck related to power management. To save energy and prolong the lifetime of an IoT system, the basic idea is to allow idle devices to go to sleep. Because excessively frequent switching between the awake and asleep phases will consume a significant amount of power, it is essential to properly schedule the order of multiple communication streams among multiple devices such that the total number of wake-up events is as small as possible. Based on the typical communication protocols deployed in IoT systems, this problem can be divided into two cases: 1) the inter-superframe case and the 2) intrasuperframe case. The former case has been well studied in existing works, whereas research on the latter case is currently immature. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme for addressing the stream order scheduling (SOS) problem in the intrasuperframe case. Mobile edge computing technology is utilized in the proposed scheme to reduce the network load, and three heuristic algorithms are proposed to improve the scheme's performance. We report various tests conducted on 4800 random original IoT topologies and 19000 random Hamiltonian edge-dual topologies, and the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves optimal solutions with a very high success probability.",Edge computing;green Internet of Things (IoT);stream order scheduling (SOS),5.0,IEEE

The IoT smart devices frequently lose either IoT user's privacy or data integrity. This also makes it crucial to put a threshold on the cost of computation and load of the IoT devices, as gradually more IoT services demand access to the resources that devices offer. In this article, we propose BalancePIC, a scheme that attempts to preserve a balance in the three aspects (user privacy, data integrity in edge-assisted IoT devices, and the computational cost). It achieves the balance through a balanced truth discovery approach and a proposed enhanced technique for data privacy, which are used in IoT devices and edge server interactions. It authenticates the IoT user participation with privacy in the truth discovery process through a biometric-ECC-based authentication algorithm.

In particular, the asymptotic outage expressions provide quantitative impacts of various system parameters and enable the investigation of diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). Moreover, power allocation coefficients and/or transmission rates can be properly chosen to achieve the maximal goodput. By favor of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, the goodput maximization problems can be solved in closed form, with which the joint power and rate selection is realized by using alternately iterating optimization.

However, existing edge storage models cannot offer the security-aware data robustness and the adaptable data sharing among many uncertain users, due to the limitations of the utilized fault-tolerant storage technologies and the access control methods. In this article, we propose a secure and trust-oriented edge storage model, which would efficiently tackle the aforementioned two challenging issues in the IoT environment. More precisely, we first propose a robust and secure edge storage (RoSES) model using the totally local reconstruction code (TLRC) method presented in this article. It can achieve data robustness, high security, and lightweight computation at end devices. We further propose a trust-oriented data access (TODA) strategy for our RoSES model, which supports a wide and adaptable range of legitimate data accesses from uncertain requesters for IoT data sharing. We conduct extensive comparison and simulations to evaluate the performance of our new edge storage models. The results show that our model can efficiently realize the data storage, data recovery, and data sharing at the network edge, saving about 35% of storage cost and 76% degraded read latency.

In such a connected environment, the social IoT (SIoT) has become an emerging trend where multiple IoT devices owned by users support communication within a social circle. Trust management in the SIoT network is imperative as trusting the information from compromised devices could lead to serious compromises within the network. It is important to have a mechanism where the devices and their users evaluate the trustworthiness of other devices and users before trusting the information sent by them. The privacy preservation, decentralization, and self-enforcing management without involving trusted third parties are the fundamental challenges in designing a trust management system for SIoT. To fulfill these challenges, this article presents a novel framework for computing and updating the trustworthiness of participants in the SIoT network in a self-enforcing manner without relying on any trusted third party. The privacy of the participants in the SIoT is protected by using homomorphic encryption in the decentralized setting. To achieve the properties of self-enforcement, the trust score of each device is automatically updated based on its previous trust score and the up-to-date tally of the votes by its peers in the network with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enforce that every participant follows the protocol honestly. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and present evaluation benchmarks by prototyping the main functionality of the system. The performance results show that the system has a linear increase in computation and communication overheads with more participants in the network.

To address the challenge, this article mainly focuses on the problem of semantic representation, which is essential for processing and fusion of IoT data. To serve as a bridge, we propose a high-level framework, namely, Things2Vec, which aims to produce the latent semantic representations from the interaction of things through the graph embedding technique. These semantic representations benefit various IoT semantic analysis tasks, such as the IoT service recommendation and automation of things. In Things2Vec, we utilize the graph to model the function sequence relationships that are generated by the interaction of things, which is called the IoT context graph. Since these function sequence relationships are heterogeneous in terms of semantics, it causes general graph embeddings to fail to learn complete information. Thus, we propose a biased random walk procedure, which is tailored to capture the neighborhoods of nodes with different types of semantic relationships. Extensive experiments are carried out, and our results show that the proposed method can effectively capture the semantic relationships among context-aware data in IoT.",Graph embedding;Internet of Things (IoT);semantics,21.0,IEEE

Therefore, improving the QoE in edge-enabled IoT is still the ultimate challenge. In this article, to enhance the QoE, we propose a new QoE model to study the computation offloading.

Many of the applications in these sectors, such as self-driving cars and remote surgery, are critical and high stakes applications, calling for advanced machine learning (ML) models for data analytics. Essentially, the training and testing data that are collected by massive IoT devices may contain noise (e.g., abnormal data, incorrect labels, and incomplete information) and adversarial examples. This requires high robustness of ML models to make reliable decisions for IoT applications. The research of robust ML has received tremendous attention from both academia and industry in recent years. This article will investigate the state of the art and representative works of robust ML models that can enable high resilience and reliability of IoT intelligence. Two aspects of robustness will be focused on, i.e., when the training data of ML models contain noises and adversarial examples, which may typically happen in many real-world IoT scenarios. In addition, the reliability of both neural networks and reinforcement learning framework will be investigated. Both of these two ML paradigms have been widely used in handling data in IoT scenarios.

However, the diversity of user demands and satellite resource poses a great challenge in evaluating the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the satellite constellation. In this article, a QoE-aware satellite constellation design scheme is proposed to enhance the user satisfaction by constructing QoE factors. First, an SIoT network model is established with low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the problem is formulated to calculate the QoE for different areas after analyzing the dynamic network topology. Then, the QoE factors are defined to assess QoE by taking into account the coverage performance, communication fluency, regional demand capacity, and profitability. Following that, an intelligent optimization algorithm named multilayer tabu search (MLTS) is designed to obtain reasonable satellite orbits with the best QoE, which provides orbit parameters for satellite constellation configuration. The simulation results demonstrate that the designed satellite constellation can effectively improve the users QoE by optimizing the various QoE factors.",Intelligent optimization;Quality of Experience (QoE);satellite constellation design;Satellite Internet of Things (SIoT),50.0,IEEE

Moreover, IPv6 routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL), a de facto routing protocol for IoT networks, also suffers from certain vulnerabilities based on its features and functionalities. Researchers have proposed various mitigation mechanisms for secure networks and routing in IoT. Recently, trust-based approaches have gained tremendous interest from the research community to embed security in IoT networks and routing protocols. In the existing literature, several trust models have been introduced according to the security needs of the IoT system, such as SecTrust, DCTM-IoT, CTRUST, etc. In this research, security issues and requirements of IoT networks and RPL routing protocol are studied with respect to various attacks, such as Blackhole, Spoofing, Rank, etc. Additionally, various mitigation methods and significance of trust models in IoT for secure routing are analyzed.

Unfortunately, the current sub-6-GHz band is already congested, and lower-band communication is hard to support the high data rate transmission. The millimeter-wave (mmWave)-based communication technology is a promising solution to support the high rate transmission in a new band. However, the high power consumption and hardware cost of the mmWave communication system violates the low-cost design principle of IoT devices, which is a heavy burden for the mmWave application on IoT. In this work, we propose the multiple IoT nodes access-based wireless beam modulation (WBM) technology for the mmWave transmission, where the WBM employs the over-the-air modulation to achieve the low-cost mmWave hardware design with hundreds of megabit per second transmission. To support multiple IoT nodes access, we first design a hyper grant-based and grant-free protocols to achieve the balance between robustness and low latency access. The multiple beam search method is proposed to accelerate the beam alignment process. The channel estimation of WBM is achieved by the pilot detection and beam estimation process, where an iterative pilot cancelation beam estimation method is proposed.

Ji,2021,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3052007,"The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has prompted the continuous increase of research efforts in recent years. In light of the diversified use cases and service requirements, the information freshness [or Age of Information (AoI)] of IoT data is key for latency-sensitive IoT applications (e.g., industrial automation and intelligent transportation) because stale information may lead to delayed responses and catastrophic outcomes. In addition, various types of IoT applications require the analytics of IoT data collected from their constituent IoT devices. While previous AoI-related works have analyzed or optimized the information freshness of various communication systems, the problem that the information cofreshness [or Coage of Information (CoI)] of an IoT application is determined by the maximum AoI of the constituent IoT devices has been rarely investigated. In this article, we address the grant assignment and transmission scheduling (GATS) problem for IoT and formulate it as an integer linear program (ILP) to minimize a weighted sum of CoI. Due to the intractability of the original GATS problem, we transform it to an equivalent problem of the maximization of the number of the eliminated age blocks. Then, we propose the CoI-aware age block elimination (CABEL) algorithm in which information updates are selected progressively according to their coage efficiency (CE) values and prove that the achieved approximation factor depends on the relative service costs and uplink delays.

In the model, a mining task assigned to a blockchain node (BN) is encoded with a specific encoding function. Thus, the final result, i.e., newly generated block or block verification result, can be decoded even when only some mining outputs returned by BNs are correct, while other outputs are erroneous or discarded due to delays. To be decoded correctly, the number of mining outputs returned prior to decoding must be at least a given decoding threshold. Then, security against malicious BNs and resilience against stragglers can be guaranteed if the number of mining tasks allocated to BNs is not less than the sum of decoding threshold, number of stragglers, and double of the number of malicious BNs. Unlike other IoT blockchains and LCC-based methods showing enhanced throughput but yielding poor security, our model can improve throughput without compromising on security. This is achieved through optimized load allocations when the higher loads (two or more mining tasks) are allocated to the fastest BNs leading to: 1) increased number of mining outputs returned prior to decoding required to meet the decoding threshold and 2) increased number of allocated mining tasks to strengthen security and resilience. To overcome the limitation of our model related to higher loads and, hence, higher mining costs to BNs, we develop a contract-theoretic mechanism that incentivizes each BN to complete its mining task through joint load and transaction fee allocations.",,17.0,Semantic Scholar

To satisfy stringent requirements on the latency of IoT communications, the IoT devices communicate in the finite blocklength regime, wherein the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) has a backoff factor and decoding error probability is nonnegligible. Aiming to jointly optimize the sum SE and the maximum error probability, we first express the achievable SE as a function of the channel coefficients, precoders, and error probabilities. Subsequently, we formulate a problem with respect to precoders and error probabilities. A straightforward approach for the formulated problem, however, is challenging as it not only has multiple objectives but also is nonconvex. To resolve these issues, we first transform the problem as a single-objective optimization by using a weighted sum approach. Based on the reformulation, we propose an algorithm, in which error probabilities and precoders are determined by alternating two phases. Via simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method offers significant gains compared to baseline methods, in terms of the achievable SE and the maximum error probability.

Therefore, trust management is a backbone for the successful and secure transmission of data among various nodes in a large-scale IoT network. To overcome the security issues, latency, and risk of malicious activities, a lightweight approach is proposed for those nodes in Industrial IoT that cannot maintain security. LightTrust utilizes a centralized trust agent to generate and manage trust certificates that allow nodes to communicate for a specific time without performing trust computations. Trust agents also maintain a trust database to store the current trust degree for the aggregation/propagation purposes. Trust between two nodes is developed by direct observations in terms of compatibility, cooperativeness, and delivery ratio, whereas recommendations are used to develop trust in the context of indirect observations, i.e., experience or previous knowledge. The comparative simulations of the proposed and existing approaches are also performed whereby the results illustrate that the proposed approach efficiently maintains resilience and robust environments.",Digital revolution;edge nodes;Industrial IoT (IIoT);Internet of Things (IoT);potential attacks;robust security;trust management,41.0,IEEE

Device-to-Device (D2D) authentication of these networks ensures the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of information in the deployed area. The literature suggests different approaches to address security issues in CPS technologies. However, they are mostly based on centralized techniques or specific system deployments with a higher cost of computation and communication. It is therefore necessary to develop an effective scheme that can resolve the security problems in CPS technologies of IoT devices. In this article, a lightweight hash media access control destination sequence distance vector (Hash-MAC-DSDV) routing scheme is proposed to resolve authentication issues in CPS technologies, connected in the form of IoT networks. For this purpose, a CPS of IoT devices (multi-WSNs) is developed from the local chain and public chain, respectively. The proposed scheme ensures D2D authentication by the Hash-MAC-DSDV mutual scheme, where the MAC addresses of individual devices are registered in the first phase and advertised in the network in the second phase. The proposed scheme allows legitimate devices to modify their routing table and unicast the one-way hash authentication mechanism to transfer their captured data from the source toward the destination.

CPS integrates the information sensed by the current physical sensors, through high-speed real-time transmission, and then carries out powerful information processing to effectively interact and integrate the physical and the information worlds. With the aim to improve the quality of service, optimize the existing physical space, and increase security, collaborative filtering algorithms have also been widely used in various recommendation models for Internet of Things (IoT) services. However, general collaborative filtering algorithms cannot capture complex interactive information in the sparse Mashup–Web service call matrix, which leads to lower recommendation performance. Based on the artificial intelligence technology, this study proposes a recommendation algorithm for a security collaborative filtering service that integrates content similarity. A security collaborative filtering module is used to capture the complex interaction information between Mashup and Web services. By applying the content similarity module to extract the semantic similarity information between the Mashup and Web services, the two modules are seamlessly integrated into a deep neural network to accurately and quickly predict the rating information of Mashup for the Web services. Real data set on the intelligent CPS is captured and then compared with mainstream service recommendation algorithms.

Ejlali,2022,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2021.3088346,"Mobile portable embedded devices are becoming an integral part of our daily activities in the vision of Internet of Things (IoT). Nevertheless, due to lack of mobility support in the IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPLs), which is standardized for multihop IoT infrastructures, providing reliable communications in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR) in mobile IoT applications has become significantly challenging. While several studies tried to enhance the adaptability of RPL to network dynamics, their utilized routing metrics have prevented them from establishing long-lasting reliable paths. Furthermore, the stochastic parent replacement policy in the standard version of RPL has intensified this challenge. Aside from this, due to the existing tradeoff between reliability and power efficiency, most of the existing approaches have only concentrated on one of these concerns without paying attention to the other one. To address these issues, this article introduces ARMOR, a routing mechanism built upon RPL, which employs a novel mobility-aware routing metric, i.e., time to reside (TTR), and a corresponding parent replacement policy. According to the motion characteristics of the mobile objects, TTR provides an estimation of how long the nodes will be in the transmission range of each other. This enables ARMOR to select nodes, which provide longer connection period and consequently higher reliability. In comparison with the state of the art, while keeping the power consumption constant, ARMOR significantly improves the amount of PDR in the network by up to  $2.5\times $ , while it enhances the reliability against the original version of this protocol by up to  $4.2\times $ .",Embedded devices;Internet of Things (IoT);mobility;neighbor table replacement;power efficiency;reliability;routing;routing protocol for low-power and lossy network (RPL),24.0,IEEE

With the rapid deployment of cameras, tasks in IoT like visual information are more important, but IoT devices have limited computing resources, including power, computing ability, storage, etc. Some tasks that might be perfectly normal to perform on a computer would be rather challenging on an IoT device. Therefore, how to maintain acceptable performance while minimizing resources is becoming a more consequential part in IoT. In this article, we aim to solve the problem of object detection and tracking in IoT while minimizing resources. The traditional algorithms need to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify different objects in each frame, and then determine the tracking target from identified objects, which typically requires a lot of computing resources. By incorporating spatial attention, and multidomain network, we proposed a novel algorithm named as spatial attention powered multidomain network (SA-MDNet). By adding the spatial attention mechanism to the original MDNet model, and using multiclass cross-entropy loss, we are able to distinguish the background and the target in different video sequences effectively and efficiently.

Scheduling Schemes for Age Optimization in IoT Systems With Limited Retransmission Times,H. Wang; X. Xie; X. Li; J.

In view of the retransmission mode, the AoI optimization problems for retransmission with and without feedback are analyzed. For the retransmission without feedback, we formulate the expected decision loss (EDL) function of the AoI optimization problem with the finite retransmission times and propose a loss-greedy policy by minimizing the EDL at each step. For the retransmission with feedback, a potential optimal solution is to construct the AoI optimization problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and solve the corresponding Bellman optimal equations. However, this optimal solution is prone to suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is hard to implement. To address this issue, we decouple the infinite-horizon MDP into the finite-state MDP in each single frame, and then propose a low-complexity slot-based max-weight (SBMW) policy to minimize the long-term average AoI.

Trust Management With Fault-Tolerant Supervised Routing for Smart Cities Using Internet of Things,K. Haseeb; T. Saba; A. Rehman; Z. Ahmed; H. H. Song; H. H. Wang,2022,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3184632,"The Internet of Things (IoT) connects heterogeneous sensors with dynamic networks to monitor smart communication and collect real-time data. Such systems are well adapted to satisfy the needs of smart cities and facilitate remote locations. Many cloud-based solutions for effective routing along with scalable data storage have been presented for constraint IoT systems. However, because of the unpredictable nature of mobile networks and communication links, most of the solutions may not be suitable for realistic applications and usually result in path failure with increasing resource utilization. Hence, data forwarding is only reliable and valuable if the proposed algorithms are trust aware with low overheads and consume balanced energy among nodes. Therefore, this article proposed a fault-tolerant supervised routing (Trust-FTSR) model for trust management in the IoT network, to improve trustworthiness and collaborative communication in smart cities. Each node evaluates the behavior of its neighbors and establishes a direct trust for a reliable and optimized network structure. In addition, using a supervised machine-learning technique, a fault-tolerant relaying system is provided without imposing additional overheads. Moreover, it removes the additional load in determining the optimal decision and training the IoT system to balance the network cost. In the end, a secure algorithm is proposed to ensure the privacy and authentication of the relaying system in the presence of critical attacks with secured keys. The proposed model is tested and its performance has significant improvement as compared to existing work.",Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning;smart cities;technological development;trust management,29.0,IEEE

CPES security evaluation is challenging since the physical and cyber layers are often not considered holistically. Existing literature focuses on only optimizing the operation of either the physical or cyber layer while ignoring the interactions between them. This article proposes a metric, the cyber–physical energy system quantitative security metric (CPES-QSM), that quantifies the interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three domains: 1) electrical; 2) cyber-risk; and 3) network topology. A method for incorporating the proposed cyber-metric into operational decisions is also proposed by formulating a cyber-constrained ac optimal power flow (C-ACOPF) that considers the status of all the CPES layers. The C-ACOPF considers the vulnerabilities of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such as voltage stability, contingencies, graph theory, and IoT cyber risks, while using a multicriteria decision-making technique.

To minimize losses and ensure an adequate emergency response, it is vital to prepare the community for greater shock absorption and recovery after an occurrence. This raises the concept of community resilience and also demands appropriate metrics and prediction models for improved preparedness and adaptability. While a community is impacted in three main ways during a disaster, namely social, physical, and cyber there are currently no tools to model their interrelationship. Thus, this article presents a multiagent cyber–physical–social model of community resilience, taking into account the interconnection of power systems, emergency services, social communities, and cyberspace. To validate the model, we used data on two hurricanes (Irma and Harvey) collected from Twitter, GoogleTrends, FEMA, power utilities, CNN, and Snopes (a fact-checking organization). We also describe methods for quantifying social metrics, such as the level of anxiety, risk perception, and cooperation using social sensing, natural language processing, and text mining tools. We examine the suggested paradigm through three different case studies: 1) hurricanes Irma and Harvey; 2) a group of nine agents; and 3) a society comprised of six distinct communities. According to the results, cooperation can positively change individual behavior. Relationships within a community are so crucial that a smaller population with greater empathy may be more resilient.

The current separation of design process and operation in the field will be superseded by a life-long design process of adaptation, infield integration, and update. Continuous change and evolution, application interference, environment dynamics and uncertainty lead to complex effects which must be controlled to serve a growing set of platform and application needs. Self-adaptation based on self-awareness and self-configuration has been proposed as a basis for such a continuous in-field process. Research is needed to develop automated in-field design methods and tools with the required safety, availability, and security guarantees. The paper shows two complementary use cases of self-awareness in architectures, methods, and tools for cyber-physical systems.

A Novel Hybrid Quantum-Crypto Standard to Enhance Security and Resilience in 6G-Enabled IoT Networks,"K. Singamaneni, A. K. Budati, Shayla Islam, Raenu Kolandaisamy, Ghulam Muhammad",2025.0,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3540905,"One of the most significant threats that hinder the effective functioning of existing models and technologies in 6G networks, particularly within the realms of Industry 5.0, is the lack of privacy and security. Traditional cryptographic models that were once considered secure have proven to be vulnerable to an expanding range of threats, such as quantum attacks. This vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized breaches and compromises the integrity and overall functionality of the network. Access control mechanisms implemented up to this point could not ensure that security compromises are prevented as secure data sharing is facilitated effortlessly. As a result, attempts to access sensitive data without authorization are often made, leaving the networks vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that have the potential to disrupt their operation. Considering these pervasive challenges, our article proposes an innovative hybrid protocol suite explicitly designed for 6G networks in Industry 5.0. Specifically, our approach integrates leading-edge technologies, such as nth-degree truncated polynomial ring unit encryption with supersingular isogeny Diffie–Hellman (NTRUEncrypt-SIDH) and key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE). It aims to address the vulnerabilities associated with traditional cryptographic models to ensure high confidentiality and authorized data sharing. Moreover, we implement modern DDoS mitigation techniques, such as rate limiting, traffic filtering, and adaptive routing, to enhance the resilience of the network and ensure that system operation remains uninterrupted. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over existing standards. Notably, the hybrid protocol achieves encryption and decryption times of 1.8 s and 1.667 s per gigabyte (GB), respectively, with a key generation time of 2.857 s per GB, ensuring efficient performance even in resource-constrained environments. The system achieves a total computational overhead of 11.7 ms for KP-ABE combined with NTRUEncrypt-SIDH, outperforming other cryptographic combinations. In addition, the model exhibits enhanced scalability, flexibility, and security, offering robust defenses against quantum and classical threats while ensuring seamless user policy-based access control. These results underscore the proposed hybrid cryptosystem's potential as a transformative standard for the secure and efficient operation of 6G networks in Industry 5.0.",,2.0,Semantic Scholar
Toward Resilience as a Tradable Parameter During Conceptual Trade Studies,A. J. Nuss; T. D. Blackburn; A. Garstenauer,2018,IEEE Systems Journal,10.1109/JSYST.2017.2703608,"Methodologies are required to model, evaluate, and analyze the resilience of system architectures at the conceptual design level to support needs evaluations, policy development, or study of social decisions. The primary objective of this paper was to develop a generalized resilience analysis model for the characterization of multistate engineered systems subject to disruptions to support system design selection during trade studies. Each design variant within the tradespace is modeled using continuous time Markov chains that simulate the transient response of each design variant subject to a user-defined disruption. The operating condition of the multistate system is characterized by a finite number of machine states. Each design variant's utility response is generated as a function of the system's machine state response to the disruption. Resilience capacities and capabilities are generated to populate trade studies. A case study consisting of an unmanned surface vessel provides a system theoretic approach to illustrate the concepts presented within this paper and demonstrates the ability of this methodology to aid decision maker's selection of resilient system architectures.

While this low energy envelope have made them near ubiquitous, it is also a huge bottleneck in real world deployments. A fine balance needs to be achieved such that these devices can perform enough meaningful computation in a reasonable amount of time to justify their deployment while consuming a reasonable amount of power to keep them running for extended periods. A common method to achieve this is through computational offloading wherein these devices move the heavy computation away to the edge and the cloud thereby increasing the network lifetime. Offloading computation from these devices also improves their performance as the computations are performed by powerful hardware at the edge and the cloud. However, this increases power consumption and network latencies from the need to transmit and receive extra synchronization data. Optimum performance can be achieved by intelligently deciding if the computation should be offloaded or performed locally - a task that is inherently difficult given the transient nature of the network and the systems. In this work, we formulate a distributed network optimization problem to achieve a balance between performance and energy consumption.

Importantly, we demonstrate the emergence of these properties after pretraining with only moderate amounts of unlabeled data, earning the name µFMs. To make the argument, evaluate model efficacy, and surface some of the underlying challenges, this paper describes a vibration-based µFM, called VibroFM, pretrained with moderate amounts of unlabeled acoustic and seismic sensing data, to support target classification and tracking applications. VibroFM is pretrained in an environment-agnostic fashion using unlabeled sensor data. It can then be fine-tuned to a given deployment using a small amount of in-situ labeled data.

Extending Ecological Network Analysis to Design Resilient Cyber-Physical System of Systems,A. Chatterjee; H. Huang; R. Malak; K. R. Davis; A. Layton,2024,IEEE Open Journal of Systems Engineering,10.1109/OJSE.2024.3368921,"The design of resilient infrastructure is a critical engineering challenge for the smooth functioning of society. These networks are best described as cyber-physical systems of systems (CPSoS): integration of independent constituent systems, connected by physical and cyber interactions, to achieve novel capabilities. Bioinspired design, using a framework called the ecological network analysis (ENA), has been shown to be a promising solution for improving the resilience of engineering networks. However, the existing ENA framework can only account for one type of flow in a network. Thus, it is not yet applicable for the evaluation of CPSoS. This article addresses this limitation by proposing a novel multigraph model of CPSoS, along with guidelines and modified metrics that enable ENA evaluation of the overall (cyber and physical) network organization of the CPSoS. The application of the extended framework is demonstrated using an energy infrastructure case study.

Power system operation incorporating active distribution grids: A system of systems framework,Yong Fu,2015,2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting,10.1109/PESGM.2015.7286126,"In restructured power systems, the transmission and distribution grids are autonomously utilized by independent system operator (ISO) and distribution companies (DISCOs), respectively.

A successful platform must balance sufficient commonality to support economical reuse, while also providing variability and extensibility to enable innovation in system and system of systems (SoS) capabilities. These commonality/variability tradeoffs for SoS platforms are frequently tacit decisions, since there are no accepted techniques for analyzing such decisions at the scale and degree of requirements uncertainty that characterize most SoSs. The objective of our work is to develop a method for analyzing decisions about requirements for common platforms for SoSs. The method begins with the requirements tasks of identifying and selecting appropriate variabilities (variation points, variation ranges, and variation decision binding times) to support immediate SoS needs, and also enable innovation and controlled evolution. We are currently conducting a workshop and interviews with SoS experts to define the essential technical problems in SoS common platform development and identify solution constraints. We will then define a simplified SoS with limited capability requirements to use as a model problem. We will use the model problem to assess the fit of existing scope, commonality, and variability methods from software product lines to the SoS context, and extend existing economic models using real options and probabilistic models to model uncertainty in evolution requirements. While it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of our approach, it is based on proven technologies from the mature field of software product lines and so we have confidence that we can build successful SoS techniques from this foundation.",system of systems;software requirements;platform engineering;software product lines;system of systems architecture,3.0,IEEE

How to reduce the downtime and locate the failures becomes a core issue in system design. In this paper, we employ a hierarchical contract-based resilience framework to guarantee the stability of CPS. In this framework, we use Assume Guarantee (A-G) contracts to monitor the non-functional properties of individual components (e.g., power and latency), and hierarchically compose such contracts to deduce information about faults at the system level. The hierarchical contracts enable rapid fault detection in large-scale CPS. However, due to the vast number of components in CPS, manually designing numerous contracts and the hierarchy becomes challenging. To address this issue, we propose a technique to automatically decompose a root contract into multiple lower-level contracts depending on I/O dependencies between components. We then formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to search the optimal parameters of each lower-level contract. This enables automatic contract refinement taking into consideration the communication overhead between components.

Industrial CPS in particular need to simultaneously satisfy requirements of available, secure, safe and reliable system operation against diverse threats, in an adaptive and sustainable way. These adverse events can be of accidental or malicious nature and may include natural disasters, hardware or software faults, cyberattacks, or even infrastructure design and implementation faults. They may drastically affect the results of CPS algorithms and mechanisms, and subsequently the operations of industrial control systems (ICS) deployed in those critical infrastructures. Such a demanding combination of properties and threats calls for resilience-enhancement methodologies and techniques, working in real-time operation. However, the analysis of CPS resilience is a difficult task as it involves evaluation of various interdependent layers with heterogeneous computing equipment, physical components, network technologies, and data analytics. In this paper, we apply the principles of chaos engineering (CE) to industrial CPS, in order to demonstrate the benefits of such practices on system resilience. The systemic uncertainty of adverse events can be tamed by applying runtime CE-based analyses to CPS in production, in order to predict environment changes and thus apply mitigation measures limiting the range and severity of the event, and minimizing its blast radius.",Cyber-physical systems;industrial control systems;chaos engineering;resilience,7.0,IEEE
Analyzing Implicit Interactions to Identify Weak Points in Cyber-Physical System Designs,L. Newton; J. Jaskolka,2021,2021 Resilience Week (RWS),10.1109/RWS52686.2021.9611810,"Cyber-physical systems often consist of many interacting components with numerous communication paths, some of which may be unintended and/or unforeseen by system designers. The existence of such paths, known as implicit interactions, represent security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to mount cyberattacks and destabilize a system. For any system with an abundance of implicit interactions, it can be difficult to understand which aspects of the design contribute most to the presence of this vulnerability. In this paper, we present an approach to identify weak points in the designs of cyber-physical systems based on frequency analyses of the interactions, both implicit and intended, present in a system design. We demonstrate the approach with a real-world Wastewater Dechlorination System. The proposed method can aid system designers in understanding which aspects of their systems contribute most to the existence of implicit interactions to enable effective mitigation strategies to improve overall system security and resilience.",implicit interactions;frequency analysis;cyber-physical systems;weak points,1.0,IEEE

IoT applications are present in many fields ranging from mining and exploration to security and surveillance. This arguably, is the second Internet revolution. For traditional internet applications, the wireless channel is the main communication medium. IoT networked applications, however, can be deployed in different environments such as underwater and subterranean. In these environments, the wireless communication medium is obviously not air. Radio signal suffers severe attenuation in water. In contrast, acoustic signal performs much better. For this reason acoustic signal is often considered in underwater IoT networks. Several factors affect the propagation of acoustic signal in water including frequency, distance, temperature, shipping activity, wind, salinity, depth and density. Given the many variables affecting the channel, simple mathematical modeling is not adequate and comprehensive models get very complex very quickly. Simulation modeling then becomes the only viable alternative for the modeling and analysis of underwater networks. Aside from a basic model in ns-2 & ns-3, there aren't any other simulators that model signal propagation for underwater environments. In this work, we develop a module for the acoustic channel in JiST/SWANS (Java in Simulation Time / Scalable Wireless Ad hoc Network Simulator). JiST/SWANS is a high-performance discrete event simulator written in Java, and it is very efficient in its memory usage. This makes it ideal for modeling and simulation of a large number of nodes, a typical scenario in IoT networks. We perfomed several simulation scenarios to validate our module.

However, the processing and energy demands of this protocol are two essential parameters that must be taken into account with respect to the resource-constraint nature of IoT devices. In this paper, we study the resource consumption of the TLS handshake using a testbed in which an IoT board (Cypress CYW43907) communicates with a Raspberry Pi server over an 802.11 wireless link. Although TLS supports a wide-array of encryption algorithms, we focus on the performance of TLS using three of the most popular and robust cipher suites. Our experiments show that ciphers using Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDHE) key exchange are considerably more efficient than ciphers using Diffie Hellman (DHE). Furthermore, ECDSA signature verification consumes more time and energy than RSA signature verification given ECDHE key exchange.

Using cryptographic methods to ensure data confidentiality is one of the most common ways for mitigating data confidentiality attacks. Since traditional encryption approaches need important CPU and memory capacity as well as increasing time and energy consumption, researchers have developed a variety of lightweight cryptographic algorithms to provide IoT environments with solutions that take into consideration IoT resources limitations while offering adapted security level. Managing lightweight cryptographic features in an IoT ecosystem is extremely difficult due to the large number of objects, the nature of IoT devices that do not accept the implementation of all possible lightweight solutions, the heterogeneity of the captured data, and the energy required for these lightweight solutions. To address this problem, we propose a novel IoT framework in which lightweight cryptographic features are self-managed according to the Autonomic Computing paradigm in order to ensure IoT data confidentiality while enhancing IoT system performance and extending IoT device lifetime.",Internet of Things;IoT data confidentiality;Autonomic Computing;Self-management;IoT architecture,,IEEE

It is very necessary to fully inspect the Internet of Things system before it is actually deployed, so as to find the errors and defects in the system design as soon as possible and make improvements. Compared with conventional simulation and testing, the formal method has the advantages of low cost, short cycle and simple steps, which provides efficient support for the inspection and analysis of the Internet of Things system before deployment. Based on the stateful timed communication sequence process (STCSP), we consider the formal modeling framework for the Internet of things system from the perspective of external environment input and system architecture. We then propose a hierarchical formal modeling method for the Internet of things system oriented to user behavior. Taking the elderly home monitoring application scene as an example, as the input of the external environment, the user behavior and its implementation object are combined into a whole for modeling, so as to keep the two states in sync, restrict each other, and avoid unrealistic sequence of activities. From the perspectives of perception mode, communication mode, predefined rules and application services, we have completed the hierarchical modeling of the three-layer architecture of the Internet of Things system, that is, perception layer, middle layer and application layer. Finally, the model verification tool PAT analyzes and verifies the above model from the aspects of security, accessibility, and system consistency.

To do so, the individual participating communications systems must be adaptive in response to ever-changing on-mission events such as, network congestion (e.g., degraded comms links and excessive network traffic), enemy interference (e.g., jamming, cyber-attacks), line of sight degradation (e.g., weather conditions). These challenges cause traditional communications systems networks to drop packets, which they presently do according to pre-specified Quality of Service (QoS) policies. However, these QoS policies alone do not actually mitigate the congestion problem because the impacted streams employ reliable communications protocols, such as TCP, that require dropped packets to be retransmitted over the same route. This approach can make the congestion problem even worse and waste the valuable bandwidth. The approach presented here introduces the novel System of Systems (SoS) for Distributed Disaggregated Communications via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Backpressure (D2CRaB) to overcome the above stated limitations. D2CRaB does so in two ways: (1) by bridging route selection and congestion control via a new backpressure scheme and (2) by leveraging RL to enable the dynamic and continuous adaptation to changing network conditions. These new advancements, greatly extend the available bandwidth of the original congested communications system to that available of other communications systems within the multi-domain SoS.

SoS often involve complex interactions and interdependencies between systems, and as a result, they can be challenging to design, manage, and maintain. Resilience is the ability of a system to withstand and recover from disruptive events. When considering a system of systems, resilience becomes a key factor as disruptions in one system may have a cascading effect on the other systems. To ensure resilience in such complex environment, constraint programming (CP) can be used to model and optimize the system's behavior, and to find the optimal configuration that satisfies all constraints. This approach can help identify the best reconfiguration options that meet specific objectives, such as maximizing system performance, minimizing costs, or minimizing risks. Compared to previous works that primarily performs SoS reconfiguration by moving the failed system into a degraded operating mode to maintain acceptable functioning, this work focuses on a type of system failure, so that degraded mode is not possible. A constraint-based reconfiguration approach is developed, allowing the system to continue operating efficiently in the face of unexpected events.

On functional safety methods: A system of systems approach,A. K. Saberi; E. Barbier; F. Benders; M. van den Brand,2018,2018 Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon),10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369598,"The advent of automated driving and mobility as a service brings the automotive industry to a new era. Moreover, connectivity plays a crucial role in enabling automated vehicles to navigate, as well as in regulating this newly established network of connected vehicles as efficiently and safely as possible. As a result, modern vehicles are equipped with Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to other systems (V2X) communication capabilities. Vehicles, traditionally considered as a monolithic system, now become part of an ecosystem of vehicles, infrastructure and mobility services that can be characterized as a System of Systems (SoS). This creates a need for safety methods that are applicable for analyzing SoS. In this paper, we investigate the impact of applying safety analysis to a SoS with a conventional, ""vehicle-centric"" development process. We propose a tailored safety lifecycle based on guidelines of ISO 26262 that is augmented to encompass additional considerations pertinent to a SoS. We performed a comparative study by applying our proposed method as well as the traditional (vehicle-centric) approach as per ISO 26262 for safety engineering of a truck platooning application. The comparison results show the overall effectiveness of the proposed method. The ""connected vehicles"" development process resulted in more safety goals compared with the vehicle-centric approach. This may, at first thought, suggest that this approach requires a significant effort increase as the number of safety goals is an indicator of the amount of needed effort for the safety engineering process. However, the safety analysis (e.g. fault tree analysis) of the platoon system from a vehicle-centric approach exponentially grows in size. This increase in complexity of analyses of the traditional vehicle-centric approach means that the actual effort required of the proposed method for the SoS is comparatively more efficient. Besides, the proposed method showed us that the resulting safety analysis, in particular, the fault trees are less prone to error as the complexity of the analysis is greatly reduced. Creating an appropriate level of abstraction for the vehicle and the platoon makes the analysis more effective. The reduced complexity also impacts verification and validation activities as vehicle and platoon level testing are specified and conducted separately. This research shows the increased trust in the safety of the platoon system by performing a ""connected vehicles"" safety analysis.",Functional Safety;System of Systems;Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment;Ecosystem Functional Safety,15.0,IEEE

This new hybrid cloud infrastructure makes it possible to mix and match platforms and cloud providers for various software development activities. There are several benefits of the multi-cloud infrastructure such as lower level of vendor lock-in and minimize the risk of widespread data loss or downtime. However, it has many challenges such as non-standard and inherent complexity due to different technologies, interfaces, and services.

Indeed, on the one hand, at design-time, most often we do not know which are the concrete IoT systems that will become constituents of the SoS, these being predominantly identified at run-time; on the other hand, the correct architecture depends not only on the constituent systems but also, largely, on the operational environment where the SoS will be deployed. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the notion of self-organization, whose mechanism makes possible that the IoT constituent systems themselves create and maintain a valid architecture enabling the production of the required emergent behavior to fulfil the SoS mission.

Consequently, the needs of patients with chronic diseases are increasing and becoming more complex and multi-faceted; they require addressing not only the physical body, but also behavioral, emotional, and spiritual health. The current healthcare delivery system organically developed to address acute conditions, primarily injury and infection during the mid-19th century, a time when the body was viewed as a machine. This led to the organization of the healthcare delivery system by organ systems into specialties and departments. However, the healthcare delivery system today needs to provide healthcare services that span multiple systems to provide the care patients need. Such care requires services from multiple specialties (e.g., podiatry and endocrinology for diabetes, primary care and psychiatry for behavioral health, and palliative care MDs and chaplains & social workers for end-of-life care) that each effectively functions as its own system. There are currently several limitations and difficulties in designing patient-oriented healthcare services utilizing a system of systems framework. First, clinical models describe the service with a focus on resources. Second, the description tends to be at a high-level of abstraction, leaving the details to the implementer. Finally, the patient is generally modeled as an operand non-participatory agent, being pushed and pulled through the system. This paper describes the use of engineering and systems principles to design patient-oriented healthcare services that provide detail and quantification that classic services do not model. In doing so, these designed system of system models incorporate the detail, data quantification and implementation level information to allow for the success of the clinical aspect of the model to be achieved.

The complex interconnected living environment is becoming a central focus for improvement given its strong influence on health in general and on how chronic conditions arise and persist. Such a strong focus on our community living environment has prompted various level regions (i.e. cities, districts) to take action in their communities. Stakeholders have turned to national data sources to inform a region of the many factors that describe it. However, these multiple factor datasets should be analyzed holistically as a system rather than individually.

Therefore, designing a secure and resilient WES is critical. This paper first proposes a system-of-systems (SoS) framework for the cyber-physical WES. Specifically, on the one hand, we adopt a game-theoretic model to capture the interactions between the WES system defender and the adversary at the cyber layer. The outcome of this cyber defense game is reflected by control-aware Nash equilibria. On the other hand, we devise a cyber-aware robust and resilient switching controller based on a Markov jump linear system model for the physical WES. The performances of the WES cyber and physical layers are interdependent due to their natural couplings. We further investigate the SoS equilibrium of the integrated WES, which considers the system security, robustness, and resilience holistically. Finally, we use case studies to corroborate the developed cross-layer design principles for the cyber-physical WES. Note to Practitioners—Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern of wind energy system (WES) operators as an increasing amount of IoT devices are adopted for WES’s communication, monitoring, and operation support purposes. This cyber-physical integration in WES creates a much broader attack surface because adversaries can compromise the physical WES by attacking its dependent cyberspace. To mitigate the impact of attacks, the operator should not only design intelligent control strategies for WES but also strategically secure the WES’s cyber layer. These two goals are naturally coupled together. On the one hand, the WES operates under different compromised conditions depending on the attack actions at the cyber layer. Thus, the control design needs to be adversary-aware by taking the real-time cyber state into account. On the other hand, the adversary’s cyberattack strategy is influenced by the induced performance degradation of WES. Hence, the corresponding attack measures and countermeasures, in turn, should be physically control-aware. This paper establishes a holistic mathematical framework to simultaneously address these two challenging objectives. The obtained solution provides guidelines for the WES operator on the optimal security resource investment in defending against cyberattacks and the robust switching control design to mitigate the impacts of attacks further. This methodology creates a defense-in-depth paradigm for the WES operators to maintain the energy system efficiency in the adversarial environment. This cross-layer design approach is also efficient and user-friendly for online implementation with the developed iterative algorithm. The simulated-based case studies in this paper show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, a more thorough validation of the method in practice is necessary before its integration with the production standard.",Wind energy system;cyber-physical security;cross-layer design;switching control;interdependence,22.0,IEEE
CapOS: Capacitor Error Resilience for Energy Harvesting Systems,"Jongouk Choi, Hyunwoo Joe, Changhee Jung",2022.0,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,10.1109/TCAD.2022.3202861,"Energy harvesting systems have emerged as an alternative to battery-operated Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To deal with frequent power outages in the absence of battery, energy harvesting systems rely on a capacitor-backed checkpoint mechanism also known as just-in-time (JIT) checkpointing. It checkpoints volatile data in nonvolatile memory (NVM) just before a power outage occurs—using the energy buffered in the capacitor—and restores the checkpointed data from NVM in the wake of the outage. While the JIT checkpointing gives an illusion that volatile data survive a power outage as if they were nonvolatile, it turns out that due to capacitor degradation, energy harvesting systems can unexpectedly fail the JIT checkpointing, losing or corrupting data across the outage. To address the problem, this article presents an operating system-driven solution called CapOS. At a high level, CapOS diagnoses the capacitor in a reactive yet safe manner. When the JIT checkpoint failure occurs, CapOS detects the capacitor degradation without causing the data corruption. To recover from such a capacitor error, CapOS electrically isolates the degraded capacitor—so that it restores its original capacitance by itself with the help of capacitor’s resilient nature—and disables the JIT checkpointing. In case, power outages occur during the capacitor isolation, CapOS leverages undo logging with interval-based checkpointing for their recovery. Once the capacitor is fully recovered, CapOS gets back to the capacitor-based JIT checkpointing. The experimental results demonstrate that CapOS can effectively address the capacitor error of energy harvesting systems at a low run-time cost, without compromising the recovery of power outages.",,8.0,Semantic Scholar

IoT-Enabled Adaptive Context-Aware and Playful Cyber-Physical System for Everyday Energy Savings,Ching-Hu Lu,2018.0,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,10.1109/THMS.2018.2844119,"Home energy savings via eco-feedback is often considered a serious, tedious, or even distracting task due to the need for frequent human intervention. In addition, most existing eco-feedback systems focus on providing energy usage information and ignore the users’ contexts. This may render the systems incapable of capturing the users’ changes when proenvironmental behaviors have been encouraged. To address this, our study leverages Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies to realize an adaptive, context-aware, and playful cyber-physical system (CPS) for everyday energy savings with the hope of facilitating collaboration between a person and a smart energy-saving (ES) system to the greatest extent possible. To leverage the benefits inherent in a CPS, bidirectionally interactive information visualization integrated with pet-raising gamification was incorporated into the adaptive CPS. This synchronized the information from the user's physical environment with its counterpart in the pet's virtual environment. In order to provide flexible services, all IoT devices were agentized to form reconfigurable agents. In our experimental evaluation, this bidirectional mapping empowered users to flexibly control remote appliances anywhere and anytime in a more natural way, which enabled users to embed interactions with the ES CPS into their daily routine. Furthermore, improvements to system adaptability (33% in precision; 21% in recall) along with the reconfigurable ES services (additionally saving energy about 16.21%) show the potential of the CPS to enhance the users’ experience and prolong the users' engagement in everyday energy savings.",,34.0,Semantic Scholar

Instead, resilience is based on the assumption that a sophisticated intrusion may succeed to evade the deployed protection and runtime detection mechanisms and impact the underlying system services and assets partially (except the core sub-functionalities). The resilient system fights back through reactive and proactive intrusion tolerance mechanisms to respond to ongoing misbehaviors and recover the affected system services and components within a reasonable time interval.

Running complex tasks such as that are machine learning-based with minimum energy consumption is a challenge. It requires complex algorithms to run locally such as on middleware fog within the proximity of the devices generating data, or globally in a cloud to analyze the acquired data and create robust and smart applications. However, it depends on the type of task execution policy applied at each level; local or global, to decide on energy and performance efficiency, since certain tasks are high in complexity. Hence, task execution will be hierarchically distributed among the IoT nodes, fog, and cloud. Given that, we present in this paper a three-tier IoT-fog-cloud model. We argue that with distributed task execution, we can achieve high scalability of IoT services, and manage the global energy consumption as well. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our three-tier architecture by taking into account computational tasks for various applications in IoT related to medical, multimedia, location-based, and text.

Among other data types, images are widely transmitted and utilized across various IIoT applications, ranging from sensor-generated visual data and real-time remote monitoring to quality control in production lines. The encryption of these images is essential for maintaining operational integrity, data confidentiality, and seamless integration with analytics platforms. This paper addresses these critical concerns by proposing a robust image encryption algorithm tailored for IIoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).

The Rule 30 cellular automata serves as an efficient mechanism for generating pseudo-random sequences that enable fast encryption and decryption cycles suitable for realtime sensor data in industrial settings.

Extensive security analysis has been carried out to validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

Studies on such solutions generally reference the specific communication medium while negating the complete architecture of the IoT system. From a system perspective, a complete IoT solution can be separated into three categories, the data collector, the communication method and the cloud platform service. The data collector relates to the embedded system device (or the `things' element) at the source of the application, the communication method relates to the network protocol used to send or receive the data and the cloud platform service relates to the facility used to store and process the data collected. LoRaWan and LoRa are `Long Range' technologies, which define the communication method for such IoT applied systems. LoRa defines the modulation technique, that allows for long range communication, whereas LoRaWan defines the communication and system architecture.This paper presents the design architecture and methodology of a fully functioning LoRaWan based IoT system. Such a system can be provided as a service to a given local region, by utilizing an End Device in conjunction with a LoRa transceiver, a LoRaWan Gateway and a defined cloud platform.

This PhD thesis targets robustness in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Devices are resource-constrained and connected via lossy links; therefore, fault prevention and rapid repair mechanisms are crucial. Meanwhile, monitoring should minimize the resulting energy and traffic overhead; to leave the network unconstrained during its normal operation. To tackle this problem, several integrated optimization models and efficient algorithms were proposed during the course of PhD. Our activities and results cover the monitor placement and scheduling problems. The topology is represented by a graph, and several graph related optimization problems can be solved. We aim at realizing a polynomial-time solvable monitor placement algorithm. Furthermore, to minimize the monitoring overhead and maximize longevity, monitoring roles should be balanced and alternated amongst nodes; therefore, we target optimal monitor scheduling. We propose a Binary Integer Programming problem formulation. We present the exact solution as well as an efficient heuristic.

These networks could be either a point-to-point (P2P) communication link or a point-to-multipoint (P2M) communication link, which, P2M is also known as multi-casting that addresses multiple subscribers. The P2M systems usually have diverse nodes (also called as `Things') according to services and levels of security required.

For the Internet of Things (IoT), where devices collaborate with each other to offer multiple services, TRS solve the issues of access control, decision making, reliable service delivery etc. The focus of this paper is towards robust indirect trust computation in a service-oriented, dynamic IoT environment. We propose a robust recommendation aggregation scheme which alleviates the effect of false or dishonest recommendations in indirect trust computation by performing the objective and subjective evaluation. In the objective evaluation, the value of a received recommendation is weighted by computing deviation from the average value of all the recommendation received. Subjective evaluation is performed to weight the recommender based on their age of interaction.

In particular, we analyze energy consumption and performance such as CPU and Memory utilization and execution time of numerous HE schemes using SEAL and HElib libraries on the Raspberry Pi 4 hardware platform and study energy-performance-security trade-offs.

A Speculative Computing Approach to Accelerate the Task Execution in Cyber-Physical Systems,"E.

Speculative computing lies in two ideas: i) predicting the output of specific tasks to avoid executing them, ii) computing specific heavy tasks in idle times so that, when their output is needed, other tasks do not have to wait for those heavy tasks to execute. This paper presents a solution to decrease the execution time of task pipelines in distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with the help of speculative computing. The system learns how to map a task input into its output and then predicts new inputs' results using lookup tables and speculators.

Accordingly, this paper proposes an evaluation framework to assess the differences brought about by the digital twin architectures and experimentally examines this framework through two typical architectures, widely utilized in the literature. With IoT being a common data source for digital twins, this paper utilizes an indoor environment monitoring IoT testbed to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the latency, accuracy, and AI capacity.

Analysis of the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Enhancing the Network Security Protection of Renewable Energy Systems,Zhuang Yuan,2025.0,International Journal of High Speed Electronics and Systems,10.1142/s0129156425402712,"The rapid advancement and integration of renewable energy systems (RES) such as solar, wind, and hydropower have intensified the need for robust network security solutions to protect against emerging cyber vulnerabilities. These systems are increasingly interconnected with digital grids and IoT devices, heightening their exposure to cyber threats that, if exploited, could disrupt energy supply and lead to severe socio-economic repercussions. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach to enhance network security specifically for renewable energy (RE) infrastructures, targeting vulnerabilities that affect data integrity and operational stability. This research introduces an Adaptive Spider Wasp optimizer-mutated Extreme Gradient Boosting (ASW-XGBoost) model as a novel solution designed to improve detection accuracy and enhance resilience across diverse RE networks. The proposed method initiates the creation of a dataset representative of both power system behaviors and potential cyber-attacks, pre-processed using a normalization algorithm to improve data quality. Feature extraction leverages a scalable approach to identify critical indicators unique to RE environments. The ASW-XGBoost model combines the optimization advantages of adaptive spider wasp algorithms with the classification robustness of XGBoost, allowing precise identification of attack signatures even within fluctuating renewable power outputs. Performance evaluations, conducted in simulated power networks with high renewable penetration, demonstrate that ASW-XGBoost surpasses conventional methods in both detection rate and operational efficiency. The findings underscore the model’s capacity to adapt to dynamic, renewable-intensive environments, offering a more responsive solution to evolving cyber threats.

Typically, the design of such systems proceeds in two steps. In the platform independent step, for each control loop in the system, the control designer calculates a control law and a sampling time that together ensure that the control loop has certain desired performance. Then, in the platform dependent step, these control tasks are scheduled on the platform, and a schedulability analysis determines if (and how) the control laws can be implemented and scheduled without missing the sampling deadlines.In this paper, we explore an alternative controller-scheduler co-design approach that aims to achieve optimal performance for all the individual control loops maintaining fairness. We first analyze the control systems to find out the rates at which control signals should be dropped to maintain schedulability and the optimal performance. We then use the rates to compute a schedule statically. We show a control theoretic approach to compute the effect of the rate of drops on the performance of the control systems and provide an SMT-based scheduling algorithm that takes as input control tasks, their periods, worst-case execution times, and their rate of drops, and outputs a static schedule that optimizes the performance of the control systems. We demonstrate our results through a case study on a family of inverted pendulums sharing the same processor for their control computations.","synthesis, scheduling, performance, control systems",,ACM

To address actuation in such closed-loop wireless control systems there is a strong need to rethink the communication architectures and protocols for reliability, coordination, and control. We introduce the Embedded Virtual Machine (EVM), a programming abstraction where controller tasks with their control and timing properties are maintained across physical node boundaries and functionality is capable of migrating to the most competent set of physical controllers. In the context of process and discrete control, an EVM is the distributed runtime system that dynamically selects primary-backup sets of controllers given spatial and temporal constraints of the underlying wireless network. EVM-based algorithms allow network control algorithms to operate seamlessly over less reliable wireless networks with topological changes. They introduce new capabilities such as predictable outcomes during sensor/actuator failure, adaptation to mode changes, and runtime optimization of resource consumption. An automated design flow from Simulink to platform-independent domain-specific languages, and subsequently, to platform-dependent code generation is presented.

In this article we attempt to envision the future role of standards, and how they will complement and enhance alternative choices toward the same goal. We first summarize traditional standards, then discuss alternatives and a couple of use cases, and conclude with some future directions and opportunities for standardization.",,,ACM

Furthermore, such systems are increasingly being composed to generate systems of systems that offer value-added functionality. Today, however, system of systems composition is typically ad-hoc and fragile. It requires developers to possess an intimate knowledge of system internals and low-level interactions between their components. In this paper, we outline a vision and set up a research agenda towards the generalised programmatic construction of distributed systems as compositions of other distributed systems. Our vision, in which we refer uniformly to systems and to compositions of systems as holons, employs code generation techniques and uses common abstractions, operations and mechanisms at all system levels to support uniform system of systems composition. We believe our holon approach could facilitate a step change in the convenience and correctness with which systems of systems can be built, and open unprecedented opportunities for the emergence of new and previously-unenvisaged distributed system deployments, analogous perhaps to the impact the mashup culture has had on the way we now build web applications.","Systems of systems, System composition, Distributed systems",,ACM
Conflict-Resolution Lifecycles for Governed Decentralized Autonomous Organization Collaboration,"Norta, Alex and Othman, Anis Ben and Taveter, Kuldar",2015,Proceedings of the 2015 2nd International Conference on Electronic Governance and Open Society: Challenges in Eurasia,10.1145/2846012.2846052,"Recent blockchain-technology related innovations enable the governance of collaborating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to engage in agile business-network collaborations that are based on the novel concept of smart contracting. DAOs utilize service-oriented cloud computing in a loosely coupled collaboration lifecycle with the main steps of setup, enactment, possible rollbacks and finally, an orderly termination. This lifecycle supports the selection of services provided and used by DAOs, smart contract negotiations, and behavior monitoring during enactment with the potential for breach management. Based on a sound understanding of the collaboration lifecycle in a Governance- as-a-Service (GaaS)-platform, a new type of conflict management must safeguard business-semantics induced consistency rules. This conflict management involves breach detection with recovery aspects. To fill the detected gap, we employ a formal design-notation that comprises the definition of structural and behavioral properties for exploring conflict-related exception- and compensation management during a decentralized collaboration. With the formal approach, we generate a highly dependable DAO-GaaS conflict model that does not collapse under left-behind clutter such as orphaned processes and exponentially growing database entries that require an unacceptable periodic GaaS reset.","smart contract, service orientation, open cloud ecosystem, e-governance, conflict resolution, business process, Industry 4.0, Decentralized autonomous organization",,ACM
Toward Smart Embedded Systems: A Self-aware System-on-Chip (SoC) Perspective,"Dutt, Nikil and Jantsch, Axel and Sarma, Santanu",2016,Association for Computing Machinery,10.1145/2872936,"Embedded systems must address a multitude of potentially conflicting design constraints such as resiliency, energy, heat, cost, performance, security, etc., all in the face of highly dynamic operational behaviors and environmental conditions. By incorporating elements of intelligence, the hope is that the resulting “smart” embedded systems will function correctly and within desired constraints in spite of highly dynamic changes in the applications and the environment, as well as in the underlying software/hardware platforms. Since terms related to “smartness” (e.g., self-awareness, self-adaptivity, and autonomy) have been used loosely in many software and hardware computing contexts, we first present a taxonomy of “self-x” terms and use this taxonomy to relate major “smart” software and hardware computing efforts. A major attribute for smart embedded systems is the notion of self-awareness that enables an embedded system to monitor its own state and behavior, as well as the external environment, so as to adapt intelligently. Toward this end, we use a System-on-Chip perspective to show how the CyberPhysical System-on-Chip (CPSoC) exemplar platform achieves self-awareness through a combination of cross-layer sensing, actuation, self-aware adaptations, and online learning. We conclude with some thoughts on open challenges and research directions.","variability, resilience sensor, resilience estimation, reliability modeling, prediction, dynamic reliability management, Index terms—dynamic power management",,ACM

Using a mass casualty incident response system as a common working example for different types of a SoS, we model the types of SoS with probabilistic models of PRISM, which can capture uncertain behaviors of an SoS in a quantitative manner and perform statistical model checking in order to verify to which extent each type of SoS achieves the SoS-level goal.

The ultimate goal of participating systems is to satisfy the global goal of the entire IT ecosystem in which they are participating. In order to maintain autonomy and controllability over an IT ecosystem through environmental changes, orchestration strategies must be invented and implemented. In this paper, we propose a reference orchestration architecture framework, which we call ITE Arbitrator, to support IT ecosystems in accomplishing the goals of individual participant systems while simultaneously achieving system-wide goals. ITE Arbitrator provides a mechanism to decide on an adaptation strategy with an optimal configuration of available systems to satisfy local constraints while achieving its global goal.

Fundamental research is needed on ways to synchronize clocks of computing systems to a high degree, and on design methods that enable building blocks of CPS to perform actions at specified times. To realize the potential of CPS in the coming decades, suitable ways to specify distributed CPS applications are needed, including their timing requirements, ways to specify the timing of the CPS components (e.g. sensors, actuators, computing platform), timing analysis to determine if the application design is possible using the components, confident top-down design methodologies that can ensure that the system meets its timing requirements, and ways and methodologies to test and verify that the system meets the timing requirements. Furthermore, strategies for securing timing need to be carefully considered at every CPS design stage and not simply added on.

CPSoS require managing massive amounts of data, being aware of their emerging behavior, and scaling out to progressively evolve and add new systems. Cloud computing supports processing and storing massive amounts of data, hosting and delivering services, and configuring self-provisioned resources. Therefore, cloud computing is the natural candidate to solve CPSoS needs. However, the diversity of platforms and the low-level cloud programming models make difficult to find a common solution for the development and deployment of CPSoS. This paper presents the architectural foundations of a cloud-centric framework for automating the development and deployment of CPSoS service applications to converge towards a common open service platform for CPSoS applications. This framework relies on the well-known qualities of the microservices architecture style, the autonomic computing paradigm, and the model-driven software development approach.

Evaluating Resilience of Gas Pipeline Systems Under Cyber-Physical Attacks: A Function-Based Methodology,"Wadhawan, Yatin and Neuman, Clifford",2016,Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems Security and Privacy,10.1145/2994487.2994488,"In this research paper, we present a function-based methodology to evaluate the resilience of gas pipeline systems under two different cyber-physical attack scenarios. The first attack scenario is the pressure integrity attack on the natural gas high-pressure transmission pipeline. Through simulations, we have analyzed the cyber attacks that propagate from cyber to the gas pipeline physical domain, the time before which the SCADA system should respond to such attacks, and finally, an attack which prevents the response of the system. We have used the combined results of simulations of a wireless mesh network for remote terminal units and of a gas pipeline simulation to measure the shortest Time to Criticality (TTC) parameter; the time for an event to reach the failure state. The second attack scenario describes how a failure of a cyber node controlling power grid functionality propagates from cyber to power to gas pipeline systems. We formulate this problem using a graph-theoretic approach and quantify the resilience of the networks by percentage of connected nodes and the length of the shortest path between them. The results show that parameters such as TTC, power distribution capacity of the power grid nodes and percentage of the type of cyber nodes compromised, regulate the efficiency and resilience of the power and gas networks. The analysis of such attack scenarios helps the gas pipeline system administrators design attack remediation algorithms and improve the response of the system to an attack.","cyber security, cyber-physical attacks, cyber-physical threats, gas pipelines, supervisory control and data acquisition",,ACM

Underminer: A Framework for Automatically Identifying Nonconverging Behaviors in Black-Box System Models,"Balkan, Ayca and Tabuada, Paulo and Deshmukh, Jyotirmoy V. and Jin, Xiaoqing and Kapinski, James",2017,Association for Computing Machinery,10.1145/3122787,"Evaluation of industrial embedded control system designs is a time-consuming and imperfect process. While an ideal process would apply a formal verification technique such as model checking or theorem proving, these techniques do not scale to industrial design problems, and it is often difficult to use these techniques to verify performance aspects of control system designs, such as stability or convergence. For industrial designs, engineers rely on testing processes to identify critical or unexpected behaviors. We propose a novel framework called Underminer to improve the testing process; this is an automated technique to identify nonconverging behaviors in embedded control system designs. Underminer treats the system as a black box and lets the designer indicate the model parameters, inputs, and outputs that are of interest. It differentiates convergent from nonconvergent behaviors using Convergence Classifier Functions (CCFs).The tool can be applied in the context of testing models created late in the controller development stage, where it assumes that the given model displays mostly convergent behavior and learns a CCF in an unsupervised fashion from such convergent model behaviors. This CCF is then used to guide a thorough exploration of the model with the help of optimization-guided techniques or adaptive sampling techniques, with the goal of identifying rare nonconvergent model behaviors. Underminer can also be used early in the development stage, where models may have some significant nonconvergent behaviors. Here, the framework permits designers to indicate their mental model for convergence by labeling behaviors as convergent/nonconvergent and then constructs a CCF using a supervised learning technique. In this use case, the goal is to use the CCF to test an improved design for the model. Underminer supports a number of convergence-like notions, such as those based on Lyapunov analysis and temporal logic, and also CCFs learned directly from labeled output behaviors using machine-learning techniques such as support vector machines and neural networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of Underminer by evaluating its performance on several academic as well as industrial examples.","stability, machine learning, formal methods, Automatic testing",,ACM

Recent headlines highlight the lack of effective security mechanisms in IoT devices. Security threats in IoT arise not only from vulnerabilities in individual devices but also from the composition of devices in unanticipated ways and the ability of devices to interact through both cyber and physical channels. Existing approaches provide methods for monitoring cyber interactions between devices but fail to consider possible physical interactions. To overcome this challenge, it is essential that security assessments of IoT networks take a holistic view of the network and treat it as a ""system of systems"", in which security is defined, not solely by the individual systems, but also by the interactions and trust dependencies between systems.In this paper, we propose a way of modeling cyber and physical interactions between IoT devices of a given network. By verifying the cyber and physical interactions against user-defined policies, our model can identify unexpected chains of events that may be harmful. It can also be applied to determine the impact of the addition (or removal) of a device into an existing network with respect to dangerous device interactions.We demonstrate the viability of our approach by instantiating our model using Alloy, a language and tool for relational models. In our evaluation, we considered three realistic IoT use cases and demonstrate that our model is capable of identifying potentially dangerous device interactions. We also measure the performance of our approach with respect to the CPU runtime and memory consumption of the Alloy model finder, and show that it is acceptable for smart-home IoT networks.","alloy, cyber physical systems, device interaction modeling, internet of things, security and privacy",,ACM

Interface Representation Patterns: Crafting and Consuming Message-Based Remote APIs,"Zimmermann, Olaf and Stocker, Mirko and L\""{u}bke, Daniel and Zdun, Uwe",2017,Proceedings of the 22nd European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs,10.1145/3147704.3147734,"Remote Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are technology enablers for major distributed system trends such as mobile and cloud computing and the Internet of Things. In such settings, message-based APIs dominate over procedural and object-oriented ones. It is hard to design such APIs so that they are easy and efficient to use for client developers. Maintaining their runtime qualities while preserving backward compatibility is equally challenging for API providers. For instance, finding a well suited granularity for services and their operations is a particularly important design concern in APIs that realize service-oriented software architectures. Due to the fallacies of distributed computing, the forces for message-based APIs and service interfaces differ from those for local APIs -- for instance, network latency and security concerns deserve special attention. Existing pattern languages have dealt with local APIs in object-oriented programming, with remote objects, with queue-based messaging and with service-oriented computing platforms. However, patterns or equivalent guidance for the structural design of request and response messages in message-based remote APIs is still missing. In this paper, we outline such a pattern language and introduce five basic interface representation patterns to promote platform-independent design advice for common remote API technologies such as RESTful HTTP and Web services (WSDL/SOAP). Known uses and examples of the patterns are drawn from public Web APIs, as well as application development and software integration projects the authors have been involved in.",,,ACM
Rapid development of semantic 3D city models for urban energy analysis based on free and open data sources and software,"Wendel, Jochen and Simons, Alexander and Nichersu, Alexandru and Murshed, Syed Monjur",2017,Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Smart Cities and Urban Analytics,10.1145/3152178.3152193,"Geospatial data, specifically semantic 3D building data, plays a crucial role in urban energy analysis as spatial calculations using 3D geometries usually form the basis for energy simulation and modelling needed for numerous smart cities applications. Additional information describing the building stock, such as building materials and energetic properties but also data not directly linked to urban morphology such as weather data, environmental data, vegetation or socio-demographic data sets are required for these applications. A major drawback in the widespread applicability of urban energy analysis is the lack of available data sets as well as the costly and lengthy labor-intensive process of generation of those data sets (e.g. 3D city models or LIDAR data). While recent years have seen an opening up of urban data sets through free and open data portals, web services, and APIs that are used for urban energy analysis, data standardization and varying data quality still raises big challenges. This research explores different methodologies for the generation and usage of semantic 3D city models based on free and open data sources and software. In this paper, we describe four different methodologies for the generation of semantic 3D city models from available open data (geospatial data portals, LIDAR data, Open Street Map data, and remote sensing) and the tools required to achieve the task. To evaluate the suitability of these open-data sets for smart cities applications, multiple energy models, such as an energy performance model and a vertical solar radiation tool, previously developed in EIFER, have been applied to evaluate the applicability of these generated city models.","Urban energy analysis, Smart and sustainable cities, Free and open data and software, CityGML, 3D city models",,ACM
A Survey of Statistical Model Checking,"Agha, Gul and Palmskog, Karl",2018,Association for Computing Machinery,10.1145/3158668,"Interactive, distributed, and embedded systems often behave stochastically, for example, when inputs, message delays, or failures conform to a probability distribution. However, reasoning analytically about the behavior of complex stochastic systems is generally infeasible. While simulations of systems are commonly used in engineering practice, they have not traditionally been used to reason about formal specifications. Statistical model checking (SMC) addresses this weakness by using a simulation-based approach to reason about precise properties specified in a stochastic temporal logic. A specification for a communication system may state that within some time bound, the probability that the number of messages in a queue will be greater than 5 must be less than 0.01. Using SMC, executions of a stochastic system are first sampled, after which statistical techniques are applied to determine whether such a property holds. While the output of sample-based methods are not always correct, statistical inference can quantify the confidence in the result produced. In effect, SMC provides a more widely applicable and scalable alternative to analysis of properties of stochastic systems using numerical and symbolic methods. SMC techniques have been successfully applied to analyze systems with large state spaces in areas such as computer networking, security, and systems biology. In this article, we survey SMC algorithms, techniques, and tools, while emphasizing current limitations and tradeoffs between precision and scalability.","temporal logic, simulation, hypothesis testing, estimation, Statistical model checking",,ACM

Analyzing security and resilience of these complex CPSs is difficult as it requires evaluating many subsystems and factors in an integrated manner. Integrated simulation of physical systems and communication network can provide an underlying framework for creating a reusable and configurable testbed for such analyses. Using a model-based integration approach and the IEEE High-Level Architecture (HLA) [2] based distributed simulation software; we have created a testbed for integrated evaluation of large-scale CPS systems. Our tested supports web-based collaborative metamodeling and modeling of CPS system and experiments and a cloud computing environment for executing integrated networked co-simulations. A modular and extensible cyber-attack library enables validating the CPS under a variety of configurable cyber-attacks, such as DDoS and integrity attacks. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation is also supported along with several hardware attacks. Further, a scenario modeling language allows modeling of alternative paths (Courses of Actions) that enables validating CPS under different what-if scenarios as well as conducting cyber-gaming experiments. These capabilities make our testbed well suited for analyzing security and resilience of CPS. In addition, the web-based modeling and cloud-hosted execution infrastructure enables one to exercise the entire testbed using simply a web-browser, with integrated live experimental results display.","courses of action, cyber-physical systems, high-level architecture, modeling and simulation, security and resilience",13.0,"ACM, Semantic Scholar"
Synergies of system-of-systems and microservices architectures,"Cuesta, Carlos E. and Navarro, Elena and Zdun, Uwe",2016,Proceedings of the International Colloquium on Software-Intensive Systems-of-Systems at 10th European Conference on Software Architecture,10.1145/3175731.3176176,"Systems-of-Systems (SoS) are being widely embraced by both practitioners and researchers. They share properties such as distribution, evolutionary development (i.e., openness), operational and managerial independence, and emergent behavior. Those properties imply that any element (system) in an SoS is able to operate independently. Similarly, microservices are suggested as a system architecture with a strong emphasis on independence, as containers provide the required degree of isolation, and their infrastructure automation frameworks provide the means to deploy them as needed. In a microservices architecture, even data is independently managed; every service maintains its own datastore, and transaction-less interaction is emphasized. Our hypothesis in this work is that while the two approaches have been treated separately in the literature so far, they share many common characteristics, and it would be fruitful to investigate their synergies. In this paper, we analyze to what extent microservices architectures can be understood as a kind of system-of-systems, explaining some of the success of the microservices approach a consequence of their SoS properties. In addition, the best practices proposed for microservices can enable a conscious, controlled, and manageable introduction of SoS concepts into system architectures, if they are needed.","IoT, container, emergent behavior, microservices architecture, scalability, self-adaptation, system-of-systems",,ACM

Providing security in such SoSs means, among other features, forecasting and anticipating evolving SoS functionalities, ultimately identifying possible detrimental phenomena that may result from the interactions of CSs and humans. Such phenomena, usually called emergent phenomena, are often complex and difficult to capture: the first appearance of an emergent phenomenon in a cyber-physical SoS is often a surprise to the observers. Adequate support to understand emergent phenomena will assist in reducing both the likelihood of design or operational flaws, and the time needed to analyze the relations amongst the CSs, which always has a key economic significance. This article presents a threat analysis methodology and a supporting tool aimed at (i) identifying (emerging) threats in evolving SoSs, (ii) reducing the cognitive load required to understand an SoS and the relations among CSs, and (iii) facilitating SoS risk management by proposing mitigation strategies for SoS administrators.

This makes them software-intensive systems, where software becomes their most complex part. Engineering sCPS thus becomes a recognized software engineering discipline, which however, due to specifics of sCPS, can only partially rely on the existing body of knowledge in software engineering. In fact, it turns out that many of the traditional approaches to architecture modeling and software development fail to cope with the high dynamicity and uncertainty of sCPS.

However, hypervisors, such as KVM and XEN, are designed to run on a server and can not be easily restructured to fulfill the requirements such as real-time constrains from IoT products.

TCLS is simple, scalable, and easy to deploy in applications where Arm DCLS processors are widely used (e.g., automotive), as well as in new sectors where the presence of Arm technology is incipient (e.g., enterprise) or almost non-existent (e.g., space). Specifically in space, COTS Arm processors provide optimal power-to-performance, extensibility, evolvability, software availability, and ease of use, especially in comparison with the decades old rad-hard computing solutions that are still in use. This article discusses the fundamentals of an Arm Cortex-R5 based TCLS processor, providing key functioning and implementation details. The article shows that the TCLS architecture keeps the use of rad-hard technology to a minimum, namely, using rad-hard by design standard cell libraries only to protect the critical parts that account for less than 4% of the entire TCLS solution. Moreover, when exposure to radiation is relatively low, such as in terrestrial applications or even satellites operating in Low Earth Orbits (LEO), the system could be implemented entirely using commercial cell libraries, relying on the radiation mitigation methods implemented on the TCLS to cope with sporadic soft errors in its critical parts. The TCLS solution allows thus to significantly reduce chip manufacturing costs and keep pace with advances in low power consumption and high density integration by leveraging commercial semiconductor processes, while matching the reliability levels and improving availability that can be achieved using extremely expensive rad-hard semiconductor processes. Finally, the article describes a TRL4 proof-of-concept TCLS-based System-on-Chip (SoC) that has been prototyped and tested to power the computer on-board an Airbus Defence and Space telecom satellite. When compared to the currently used processor solution by Airbus, the TCLS-based SoC results in a more than 5\texttimes{} performance increase and cuts power consumption by more than half.","space avionics, soft error resilience, safety-critical, Arm",,ACM

Thus, the assessment of the security posture of cyber-physical systems, as well as the evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the defensive mechanisms become of paramount importance. Unfortunately, testing cyber security in live real-world cyber-physical systems is not advisable, even when it is possible; hence, the use of testbeds is a necessary alternative. This work surveys cyber-physical testbeds in five major application domains, with an eye towards identifying key features to be subsequently used as input to the process of defining requirements for future cyber-physical testbeds with cyber security posture assessment capability.

By following a systematic procedure of search and selection of primary studies, a set of 37 existing studies was analyzed with respect to contributions related to emergent behavior in SoS.

KinPhy: a kinetic in-band channel for millimetre-wave networks,"Alloulah, Mohammed and Radivojevic, Zoran and Mayrhofer, Ren\'{e} and Huang, Howard",2019,Proceedings of the 17th Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems,10.1145/3356250.3360039,"We propose a system for enabling auxiliary communication channels in which a node transmits a millimeter (mm) wave signal which is reflected off a deliberately vibrating surface of a second node and then received by the first node. Data sequences can be encoded in the modulation of the surface, and radar sensing techniques can be used to demodulate the reflected signal. Hence our system enables not only conventional sensing in terms of range, velocity, and orientation estimation but also allows for information to be conveyed by the sensed device. We introduce the design of a metasurface driven by an energy-efficient programmable piezo-electric actuator, detail suitable radar processing, and characterize the link performance of the kinetically induced channel at distances up to five meters. As this metasurface could be used for both mobile devices and infrastructure devices, we describe opportunities for enabling novel capabilities including secure device authentication and extended-range wireless sensing across multiple devices.","millimetre-wave, 5G",,ACM
A Typology of Architectural Strategies for Interoperability,"Valle, Pedro Henrique Dias and Garc\'{e}s, Lina and Nakagawa, Elisa Yumi",2019,"Proceedings of the XIII Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse",10.1145/3357141.3357144,"An increasing interest in researching the development, integration, composition, and evolution of large-scale, software-intensive systems (LSSIS) have been observed in the last years. These systems are presented in different domains as connected health, industry 4.0, military, smart cities, smart grids, and smart agriculture. These systems are realized through the cooperation among heterogeneous, independent, highly distributed, individual, and heterogeneous systems to achieve their business goals. For the success of these larger systems, their individual parts must interoperate among them allowing the execution of more complex functionalities. However, there are many concerns that software engineers must overcome during the composition of these systems, that can be related to (i) the misunderstanding of data formats, data semantic, procedures, contracts, standards, quality, and interfaces structures provided by individual systems; and (ii) the absence of high-level architectures to analyze, comprehend, and guide how interoperability can be addressed. The goal of this work is to present a typology of existing and proven strategies for achieving interoperability. Strategies were identified through a systematic search in scientific databases and patterns repositories. The selected strategies were categorized according to the level of interoperability they support, namely, technical, syntactic, semantic, and organizational. In each level, the strategies were divided by the type of solution their propose, i.e., technique, and architectural styles, patterns, and tactics. Moreover, statements explaining how each strategy address interoperability are given. Results of this work can be used by architects to identify and understand solutions for achieving interoperability requirements during the composition of larger systems. The resulting typology in this study is the first step to consolidate a patterns-language for interoperability in software architectures.","Typology, Tactic, Software Architecture, Interoperability, Architectural Style, Architectural Pattern",,ACM
Dynamic Task-based Intermittent Execution for Energy-harvesting Devices,"Majid, Amjad Yousef and Donne, Carlo Delle and Maeng, Kiwan and Colin, Alexei and Yildirim, Kasim Sinan and Lucia, Brandon and Pawe\l{}czak, Przemys\l{}aw",2020,Association for Computing Machinery,10.1145/3360285,"Energy-neutral Internet of Things requires freeing embedded devices from batteries and powering them from ambient energy. Ambient energy is, however, unpredictable and can only power a device intermittently. Therefore, the paradigm of intermittent execution is to save the program state into non-volatile memory frequently to preserve the execution progress. In task-based intermittent programming, the state is saved at task transition. Tasks are fixed at compile time and agnostic to energy conditions. Thus, the state may be saved either more often than necessary or not often enough for the program to progress and terminate. To address these challenges, we propose Coala, an adaptive and efficient task-based execution model. Coala progresses on a multi-task scale when energy permits and preserves the computation progress on a sub-task scale if necessary. Coala’s specialized memory virtualization mechanism ensures that power failures do not leave the program state in non-volatile memory inconsistent. Our evaluation on a real energy-harvesting platform not only shows that Coala reduces runtime by up to 54% as compared to a state-of-the-art system, but also it is able to progress where static systems fail.","intermittent computing, adaptive software, Energy-harvesting devices",,ACM

Moreover, by considering each part of a system in an isolated manner, and due to the numerous and highly complicated interactions between the different components, the system optimization capabilities are severely limited. The presented fully-distributed simulation framework (called as COSSIM) is the first known open-source, high-performance simulator that can handle holistically system-of-systems including processors, peripherals and networks; such an approach is very appealing to both Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Highly Parallel Heterogeneous Systems designers and application developers. Our highly integrated approach is further augmented with accurate power estimation and security sub-tools that can tap on all system components and perform security and robustness analysis of the overall system under design—something that was unfeasible up to now. Additionally, a sophisticated Eclipse-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed to provide easy simulation setup, execution, and visualization of results. COSSIM has been evaluated when executing the widely used Netperf benchmark suite as well as a number of real-world applications. Final results demonstrate that the presented approach has up to 99% accuracy (when compared with the performance of the real system), while the overall simulation time can be accelerated almost linearly with the number of CPUs utilized by the simulator.","CPS simulator, Distributed systems simulator, integrated simulator, parallel systems simulator",,ACM

In most IoT-based systems, especially those within smart-homes and smart-cities, there is a bridging point (fog computing) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks, as well as small amounts of data processing. The fog nodes can have useful knowledge and potential for constructive security and control over both the sensor network and the data transmitted over the Internet. Smart healthcare services utilise such networks of IoT systems. It is therefore vital that medical data emanating from IoT systems is highly secure, to prevent fraudulent use, whilst maintaining quality of service providing assured, verified and complete data. In this article, we examine the development of a Cognitive Fog (CF) model, for secure, smart healthcare services, that is able to make decisions such as opting-in and opting-out from running processes and invoking new processes when required, and providing security for the operational processes within the fog system. Overall, the proposed ensemble security model performed better in terms of Accuracy Rate, Detection Rate, and a lower False Positive Rate (standard intrusion detection measurements) than three base classifiers (K-NN, DBSCAN, and DT) using a standard security dataset (NSL-KDD).","Fog computing, cognitive fog, fog security, medical data security",,ACM
Simulation testbed for railway infrastructure security and resilience evaluation,"Neema, Himanshu and Koutsoukos, Xenofon and Potteiger, Bradley and Tang, CheeYee and Stouffer, Keith",2020,Proceedings of the 7th Symposium on Hot Topics in the Science of Security,10.1145/3384217.3385623,"The last decade has seen an influx of digital connectivity, operation automation, and remote sensing and control mechanisms in the railway domain. The management of the railway operations through the use of distributed sensors and controllers and with programmable and remotely controllable railway signals and switches has led to gains in system efficiency as well as operational flexibility. However, the network connectivity has opened up the railway cyber communication networks to cyber-attacks. These are a class of cyber-physical systems (CPS) with interconnected physical, computational, and communication components. The cyber-attacks on these systems could potentially cascade through these inter-connection and result into significant damage. These systems are safety-critical owing to their large-scale monetary and, more importantly, human life safety concerns. Therefore, it is better to incorporate security and resilience requirements right from the design time. In this paper, we describe a domain-specific framework for simulations in the railway domain. The framework allows analyzing the resilience of railway operations in the presence of cyber-attacks. In particular, our simulation framework allows modeling the railway network as well as the railway transportation. It provides an online graphical modeling environment that allows multiple users to collaborate, through a web-based interface, over the same model for the railway infrastructure as well as network attacks. The framework also allows the user to configure and run experiments through the web-interface and also to visualize the key operational metrics from the railway domain as the experiment is running. The framework also supports executing large simulations in the cloud. In addition, it supports hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation for incorporating physical effects and network attacks that can only be realized realistically in the hardware. A detailed case study is provided to demonstrate the framework's capabilities.","cybersecurity, hardware-in-the-loop, modeling and simulation, railway infrastructure, resilience",,ACM

Towards automated safety analysis for architectures of dynamically forming networks of cyber-physical systems,"Brings, Jennifer and Daun, Marian",2020,Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops,10.1145/3387940.3391474,"Dynamically forming networks of cyber-physical systems are becoming increasingly widespread in manufacturing, transportation, automotive, avionics and more domains. The emergence of future internet technology and the ambition for ever closer integration of different systems leads to highly collaborative cyber-physical systems. Such cyber-physical systems form networks to provide additional functions, behavior, and benefits the individual systems cannot provide on their own. As safety is a major concern of systems from these domains, there is a need to provide adequate support for safety analyses of these collaborative cyber-physical systems. This support must explicitly consider the dynamically formed networks of cyber-physical systems. This is a challenging task as the configurations of these cyber-physical system networks (i.e. the architecture of the super system the individual system joins) can differ enormously depending on the actual systems joining a cyber-physical system network. Furthermore, the configuration of the network heavily impacts the adaptations performed by the individual systems and thereby impacting the architecture not only of the system network but of all individual systems involved. As existing safety analysis techniques, however, are not meant for supporting such an array of potential system network configurations the individual system will have to be able to cope with at runtime, we propose automated support for safety analysis for these systems that considers the configuration of the system network. Initial evaluation results from the application to industrial case examples show that the proposed support can aid in the detection of safety defects.","cyber-physical system, safety analysis, system architecture",,ACM

In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.","DTSS, Digital twin, GEMINIS, IoT, MIAC, MRAC, adaptive control, dynamic context management, megamodel, models at runtime, reference model, self-adaptive",,ACM

Independent of their usage, be it within an IoT system or a CPS, embedded devices are always an attractive target for security attacks, mainly due to their continuous network availability and the importance of the data they handle. Thus, the design of such systems requires a thorough consideration of the various security constraints they are liable to. Introducing these security constraints, next to other requirements, such as power consumption, and performance increases the number of design choices a system designer must consider. As the various constraints are often conflicting with each other, designers face the complex task of balancing them. System designers facilitate Design Space Exploration (DSE) tools to support a system designer in this job. However, available DSE tools only offer a limited way of considering security constraints during the design process. In this article, we introduce a novel DSE framework, which allows the consideration of security constraints, in the form of attack scenarios, and attack mitigations in the form of security tasks. Based on the descriptions of the system’s functionality and architecture, possible attacks, and known mitigation techniques, the framework finds the optimal design for a secure IoT device or CPS.

We discuss four research questions addressing how software is tested in the field, what is tested in the field, which are the requirements, and how field tests are managed, and identify many challenging research directions.","in-vivo testing, field testing, ex-vivo testing, Software testing",,ACM
Symbolic reach-avoid control of multi-agent systems,"Majumdar, Rupak and Mallik, Kaushik and Salamati, Mahmoud and Soudjani, Sadegh and Zareian, Mehrdad",2021,Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems,10.1145/3450267.3450548,"We consider the decentralized controller synthesis problem for multi-agent systems with global reach-avoid specifications. Each agent is modeled as a nonlinear dynamical system with disturbances. The objective is to synthesize local feedback controllers that guarantee that the overall multi-agent system meets the global specification despite the influence of disturbances. On the one hand, existing techniques based on planning or trajectory optimization usually ignore the effects of disturbances and produce open-loop nominal trajectories that are not generally sufficient in the presence of disturbances. On the other hand, techniques based on formal synthesis, which guarantee satisfaction of temporal specifications, do not scale as the number of agents increases.We address these limitations by proposing a two-level solution approach that combines fast global nominal trajectory generation and local application of formal synthesis. At the top level, we ignore the effect of disturbances and obtain a joint open-loop plan for the system using a fast trajectory optimizer. At the lower level, we use abstraction-based controller design to synthesize a set of decentralized feedback controllers that track the high level plan against worst-case disturbances, thus ensuring satisfaction of the global specification.We provide the implementation of our approach in an open-source tool called GAMARA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GAMARA on several multi-robot examples using two particular classes of control specifications. In the first type, we assume that the robots need to fulfill their own reach-avoid tasks while avoiding collision with each other. In the second type, we require the robots to fulfill reach-avoid tasks while maintaining certain formation constraints. The experiments show that GAMARA produces formally guaranteed feedback controllers while scaling to many robots. In contrast, nominal open-loop controllers do not guarantee the satisfaction of the specification, and global formal approaches run out of memory before synthesizing a controller.",,,ACM
Formal verification of hyperproperties for control systems,"Anand, Mahathi and Murali, Vishnu and Trivedi, Ashutosh and Zamani, Majid",2021,Proceedings of the Workshop on Computation-Aware Algorithmic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems,10.1145/3457335.3461715,"In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest and research in verifying complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) against rich and expressive specifications [2] such as safety and liveness, to provide formal guarantees for safety-critical systems. While linear temporal logic (LTL) [1] can capture these properties of interest, it is incapable of specifying many information-flow properties that rely on information of multiple traces. These properties, which are described over sets of traces, are called hyperproperties [4] and their corresponding temporal logics have been well studied. The extension of LTL to capture a fragment of hyperproperties, namely, HyperLTL [3], makes use of trace variables to specify individual execution traces and allows for quantification of trace variables to precede a (trace) quantifier-free formula. Here, we present a sound approach for verifying discrete-time control systems against HyperLTL formulae through the use of so-called augmented barrier certificates (ABCs).","barrier certificates, cyber-physical systems, hyperproperties",,ACM

Satellites are non-repairable systems in orbit, and the financial loss incurred when the satellites fail before their expected mission time is substantial. If the source of a failure is known while the satellite is in orbit, then there is a possibility to revive it by sending appropriate commands from ground stations. In this work, we present a simple, independent satellite health monitoring system called Chirper. The Chirper is equipped with multiple modules such as IMU, isolated voltage and current measurement probes, and an onboard communication channel.

Conceptualizing Smart Government: Interrelations and Reciprocities with Smart City,"Anthopoulos, Leonidas and Sirakoulis, Kleanthis and Reddick, Christopher G.",2022,Association for Computing Machinery,10.1145/3465061,"Smart government (SG) is an emerging topic, which increasingly attracts attention from scholars who work in public administration, political, and information sciences. Smart city (SC) on the other hand, is an emerging and multidisciplinary domain of study. It is not clear whether the two terms SG and SC co-exist or concern different domains that interrelate and interact. The aim of this paper is to investigate the term SG; to conceptualize it with components; to define the importance of these components to the SG with their relative strengths; and to clarify its relationship with the SC term. In this respect, this paper follows a multi-method approach: a comprehensive literature review to define and conceptualize the SG, and determine its components, and a Delphi study for validating the literature findings and for calculating the relative components’ strengths. The SG definitions that are in literature have several weaknesses and the authors proposed a definition to the SG that overcomes them, while a model with three rings, three dimensions and 13 components conceptualizes it. The Delphi study showed that all the SG conceptual entities are useful, and highlighted that Citizens Engagement, Economic Growth, and Accountability are more important compared to the others, but it is hard to decide about the less important component. Third, the ICT Innovation entity appears to be the most important compared to emerging technologies and data. Finally, SC and SG are indeed related but, SC is proved to be a complimentary part of the broader SG term.","open government, e-government, digital government, smart governance, smart government, Smart city",,ACM

We use an updated vulnerability dataset that is further enriched by quantitative research data from independent studies evaluating the maturity and accomplishments of cities in their journey to become smart. We particularly focus on cities that aspire to implement a (data-driven) Circular Economy agenda that we consider to potentially yield the highest risk from a vulnerabilities exposure perspective.

Scheduling in Real-Time Mobile Systems,"Chen, Cong and Hong, Zhong and Jiang, Jian-Min",2022,Association for Computing Machinery,10.1145/3517747,"To guarantee the safety and security of a real-time mobile system such as an intelligent transportation system, it is necessary to model and analyze its behaviors prior to actual development. In particular, the mobile objects in such systems must be isolated from each other so that they do not collide with each other. Since isolation means two or more mobile objects must not be located in the same place at the same time, a scheduling policy is required to control and coordinate the movement of such objects. However, traditional scheduling theories are based on task scheduling which is coarse-grained and cannot be directly used for fine-grained isolation controls. In this article, we first propose a fine-grained event-based formal model called a time dependency structure and use it to model and analyze real-time mobile systems. Next, an event-based schedule is defined and the composition of schedules is discussed. Then, we investigate the schedulability of isolation—that is, checking whether a given schedule ensures the isolation relationship among mobile objects or not. After that, we present an automation approach for scheduling generation to guarantee isolation controls in real-time mobile systems. Finally, case studies and simulation experiments demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our approach.","ambient, scheduling policy, isolation, Mobility",,ACM

However, data-intensive applications are used more and more on such platforms. Yet embedded systems usually have limited energy, computing power, and memory/storage space. Thus, new memory and storage devices/technologies have emerged to improve performance, reduce energy consumption, and increase memory/storage capacity of embedded systems for novel embedded and IoT applications. This is the second part of the Special Issue on Memory and Storage Systems for Embedded and IoT Applications. It includes four articles that tackle some of the most recent and impactful topics and design issues of memory and storage systems for embedded and IoT applications, including in-storage computing for learning algorithms, page fault handling against CPS malware, simulation for ReRAM-based accelerators, and data management of blockchain. “Store-n-Learn: Classification and Clustering with Hyperdimensional Computing across Flash Hierarchy” proposes “Store-n-Learn” design (i.e., an in-storage computing solution) that performs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) classification and clustering by implementing encoding, training, retraining, and inference across the flash hierarchy. The proposed Store-n-Learn design exploits the internal bandwidth and hierarchical structure of SSDs to perform HDC classification and clustering in storage, so as to improve the performance of HDC classification. The article “Physics-driven Page Fault Handling for Customized Deception against CPS Malware” considers the page fault handling technique against CPS malware. To counter CPS malware, a physics-driven page fault handler in the seL4 microkernel is developed to differentiate active physics (data) in main memory from passive physics (data) in the backing store and to aid in the identification of active physics via a CPU scheduler that tracks the evolution of active physics over time. “DL-RSIM: A Reliability and Deployment Strategy Simulation Framework for ReRAM-based CNN Accelerators” aims to enable reliable and energy-efficient memristor-based accelerators.

NMTSloth: understanding and testing efficiency degradation of neural machine translation systems,"Chen, Simin and Liu, Cong and Haque, Mirazul and Song, Zihe and Yang, Wei",2022,Proceedings of the 30th ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,10.1145/3540250.3549102,"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems have received much recent attention due to their human-level accuracy. While existing works mostly focus on either improving accuracy or testing accuracy robustness, the computation efficiency of NMT systems, which is of paramount importance due to often vast translation demands and real-time requirements, has surprisingly received little attention. In this paper, we make the first attempt to understand and test potential computation efficiency robustness in state-of-the-art NMT systems. By analyzing the working mechanism and implementation of 1455 public-accessible NMT systems, we observe a fundamental property in NMT systems that could be manipulated in an adversarial manner to reduce computation efficiency significantly. Our interesting observation is that the output length determines the computation efficiency of NMT systems instead of the input, where the output length depends on two factors: an often sufficiently large yet pessimistic pre-configured threshold controlling the max number of iterations and a runtime generated end of sentence (EOS) token. Our key motivation is to generate test inputs that could sufficiently delay the generation of EOS such that NMT systems would have to go through enough iterations to satisfy the pre-configured threshold. We present NMTSloth, which develops a gradient-guided technique that searches for a minimal and unnoticeable perturbation at character-level, token-level, and structure-level, which sufficiently delays the appearance of EOS and forces these inputs to reach the naturally-unreachable threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of NMTSloth, we conduct a systematic evaluation on three public-available NMT systems: Google T5, AllenAI WMT14, and Helsinki-NLP translators. Experimental results show that NMTSloth can increase NMT systems' response latency and energy consumption by 85% to 3153% and 86% to 3052%, respectively, by perturbing just one character or token in the input sentence. Our case study shows that inputs generated by NMTSloth significantly affect the battery power in real-world mobile devices (i.e., drain more than 30 times battery power than normal inputs).","software testing, neural machine translation, Machine learning",,ACM

We present the first acoustic system that brings underwater messaging capabilities to existing mobile devices like smartphones and smart watches. Our software-only solution leverages audio sensors, i.e., microphones and speakers, ubiquitous in today's devices to enable acoustic underwater communication between mobile devices. To achieve this, we design a communication system that in real-time adapts to differences in frequency responses across mobile devices, changes in multipath and noise levels at different locations and dynamic channel changes due to mobility. We evaluate our system in six different real-world underwater environments with depths of 2--15 m in the presence of boats, ships and people fishing and kayaking. Our results show that our system can in real-time adapt its frequency band and achieve bit rates of 100 bps to 1.8 kbps and a range of 30 m.

The proposed approach and software platform should not only integrate all smart transport services, but also provide control, self-organization and evolution of ITS.The software platform developed as DE enables physical or virtual organizations provide core services based on real time schedules and current state of their resources automatically, reactively or pro-actively, and only to the customers interested in these services. It will increase the service level for clients, reduce costs and delivery time, improve scalability, performance and reliability of ITS.","Smart Transport System, Smart City, Ontology, Multiagent Technology, Digital Ecosystem, Cooperative Intelligent Transport System",,ACM
Digital twin as risk-free experimentation aid for techno-socio-economic systems,"Barat, Souvik and Kulkarni, Vinay and Clark, Tony and Barn, Balbir",2022,Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,10.1145/3550355.3552409,"Environmental uncertainties and hyperconnectivity force technosocio-economic systems to introspect and adapt to succeed and survive. Current practices in decision-making are predominantly intuition-driven with attendant challenges for precision and rigor. We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling &amp; Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making. We also discuss the rigor of our validation of the proposed approach and associated technology infrastructure through a representative sample of industry-scale real-world use cases.","agent model, decision making, digital twin, simulatable model",,ACM

Models and simulations at run-time play a crucial role to implement these control and prediction components.Real-time constraints raise the complexity of designing an efficient CPS system. Having detailed models in making decisions and/or numerous predictions in different contexts is computationally expensive and difficult to schedule on the computational infrastructure.Inspired by substitutability, one strategy for dealing with complex CPS and the contradiction of better real-time performance and reduced cost in CPS is to employ approximated models and switch to the most suited model adaptively at run-time.However, using an approximate model raises the uncertainty on the model's predictions. Nonetheless, the model is appropriate when the uncertainty is within bound. This bound is defined as tolerance which is the permitted amount of uncertainty.In this paper, we propose a method for quantifying the tolerance of cyber-physical systems, where we can switch between the original model and approximated models and how to identify more appropriate models.","adaptation, approximation, cyber-physical systems, model validity, real-time systems, tolerance quantification, uncertainty",,ACM
Bring Us MacGyver Predictor: Towards a Deep Learning-Based Mechanism to Design Emergent Behaviors in Systems-of-Systems,"Silva, Kanan Castro and Horita, Flavio and Graciano Neto, Valdemar Vicente",2022,Proceedings of the XXXVI Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering,10.1145/3555228.3555265,"Systems-of-Systems (SoS) involve independent systems called constituents that, together, achieve a set of goals by means of emergent behaviors. Those behaviors can be deliberately planned as a combination of the individual functionalities (herein named as features) provided by the constituents. Currently, SoS stakeholders heavily rely on the creativity of engineers to combine the features and draw the behaviors. The limitation of human perception in complex scenarios can lead to engineering sub-optimized SoS arrangements, offering global behaviors that are limited to the engineer’s abilities and prior experience, potentially causing waste of the resources, sub-optimal services and reducing quality.In that sense, the main contribution of this paper is introducing MacGyver Predictor, a deep learning-based mechanism for inferring/suggesting emergent behaviors that could be designed over a given set of constituents. An initial dataset was elaborated from a systematic mapping to feed the mechanism. We expect that our mechanism can extrapolate the human capabilities and glimpse global behaviors, hopefully revealing unpredicted behaviors that could be offered by the SoS and supporting engineers to architect SoS with (i) more diversified behaviors and (ii) enhanced SoS overall quality.","System-of-Systems, deep learning, emergent behavior, multi-label classification",,ACM

The supply chains are themselves vulnerable to adversarial attacks, both in a digital and physical sense, which can disrupt or at worst destroy them. In this paper, we take a look at two examples of such successful attacks to put the idea of Supply Chain Attacks into perspective, and analyse how EU and national law can prevent these attacks or otherwise punish companies which do not try to mitigate them at all possible costs. We find that the current types of national regulation are not technology specific enough, and cannot force or otherwise mandate the correct parties who could play the biggest role in preventing supply chain attacks to do everything in their power to mitigate them. But, current EU law is on the right path, and further development of this may be what is necessary to combat these large threats, as national law may fail at properly regulating companies when it comes to cybersecurity.","cybersecurity, danish law, eu law, irish law, supply chain attacks, supply chains, uk law",,ACM

However, the inference of contextual meanings of a binary is challenging due to the absence of semantic information available in source codes. Recent advances leverage the benefits of a deep learning architecture into a better understanding of underlying code semantics and the advantages of the Siamese architecture into better BCSD. In this paper, we propose BinShot, a BERT-based similarity learning architecture that is highly transferable for effective BCSD. We tackle the problem of detecting code similarity with one-shot learning (a special case of few-shot learning). To this end, we adopt a weighted distance vector with a binary cross entropy as a loss function on top of BERT. With the prototype of BinShot, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, and practicality of BinShot, which is robust to detecting the similarity of previously unseen functions. We show that BinShot outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches for BCSD.","Similarity Detection, Deep Neural Network, Binary Analysis",,ACM

Thus, this study aims to evaluate the quality of cyber-physical solutions developed from an MDD platform. For this purpose, we performed an quasi-experiment, comparing a well-stable cyber-physical solution with the same solution implemented in an MDD tool.

In this article we focus on Autonomous Passenger Ships (APS), which are being considered as a solution for passenger transport across urban waterways. The ambition of the authors has been to examine the safety and security implications of such a Cyber Physical System (CPS), particularly focusing on threats that endanger the passengers and the operational environment of the APS. Accordingly, the article presents a new risk assessment approach based on a Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) that is enriched with selected semantics and components of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, in order to utilize the encoded common knowledge and facilitate the expression of attacks. Then, the proposed approach is demonstrated through conducting a risk assessment for a communication architecture tailored to the requirements of APSs that were proposed in earlier work. Moreover, we propose a group of graph theory-based metrics for estimating the impact of the identified risks. The use of this method has resulted in the identification of risks and their corresponding countermeasures, in addition to identifying risks with limited existing mitigation mechanisms. The benefits of the proposed approach are the comprehensive, atomic, and descriptive nature of the identified threats, which reduce the need for expert judgment, and the granular impact estimation metrics that reduce the impact of bias. All these features are provided in a semi-automated approach to reduce the required effort and collectively are argued to enrich the design-level risk assessment processes with an updatable industry threat model standard, namely ATT&amp;CK.","Risk assessment, safety and security, Cyber-Physical System, autonomous ship, MITRE ATT&amp;CK, FMECA",,ACM

They often contain sub-systems from different physical domains (e.g., electrical, mechanical, and electronic) that must coordinate over a communications network to achieve a joint function. Thus, network characteristics significantly affect CPS performance and must be accurately modeled and simulated. However, simulation efforts are often siloed into specific domains (e.g., manufacturing, transportation, and electric grid) due to the level of complexity required to simulate even one domain. Co-simulation standards such as the IEEE High Level Architecture (HLA) attempt to facilitate model sharing between domains through definition of common services such as time management on a shared message bus. However, a well-developed, integrated, and configurable network simulation component that can be readily deployed in CPS co-simulations is lacking due to both the network simulation complexity and customization needed for specific domains. This paper presents a novel approach to create a highly reusable and configurable network simulation for HLA co-simulations which includes a cyber-attack library for analyzing behavior of CPS under attack. This work could provide effective means to quickly develop cyber scenarios for analyzing CPS through networked co-simulations.","cyber-physical systems, high-level architecture, modeling and simulation, networked co-simulation, system-of-systems",,ACM

Tremendous volumes of these heterogeneous data are derived from multiple IoT sources and present new challenges for the design, development, and implementation of effective information systems and decision support frameworks tomeet heterogeneous computing requirements. Emerging technologies allow for the near real-time extraction and analysis of heterogeneous data to find meaningful information. Machine-learning algorithms allow computers to learn automatically, analyzing existing data to establish rules to predict outcomes of unknown data. However, traditional machine learning approaches do not meet the needs for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, calling for new technologies. Deep learning is a good example of emerging technologies that tackle the limitations of traditional machine learning through feature engineering, providing superior performance in highly complex applications. However, these technologies also raise new security and privacy concerns. Technology adoption and trust issues are of timely importance as well. Industrial operations are in themidst of rapid transformations, sometimes referred to as Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), or smart manufacturing. These transformations are bringing fundamental changes to factories and workplaces, making them safer and more efficient, flexible, and environmentally friendly. Machines are evolving to have increased autonomy, and new human-machine interfaces such as smart tools, augmented reality, and touchless interfaces are making interaction more natural. Machines are also becoming increasingly interconnected within individual factories as well as to the outside world through cloud computing, enabling many opportunities for operational efficiency and flexibility in manufacturing and maintenance.

Researchers have raised numerous research and studies of strategies for tracking climate change. The current climate change tracking method in Rwanda employs a weather station model, in which numerous fixed weather stations are installed throughout the country; however, due to its immobility, this process cannot cover the entire country. With the lack of advanced methodologies and technology, the process of climate change tracking has become extremely expensive and suffered inaccuracies due to a lack of proper knowledge of analyzing collected data, and the lack of specific accurate hardware. Throughout this research, with the use of the MQ-135 and DHT11 sensors, ESP8266 collects carbon dioxide gas and temperature/humidity respectively and other component include a push button for detecting the current season. ESP8266 is programmed to send data over MQTT protocol, which uses Wi-Fi capability to send data to MQTT Broker. Using the MQTT protocol's Publish/Subscribe criteria, node-red subscribes to the topics defined in the MQTT broker to obtain data, which is then sent to MongoDB for permanent storage and also fed into the machine learning model for climate change/warming prediction. Different algorithms are used to evaluate this model. As result, Random Forest classifier approves itself to be the best model in evaluating the built model. This study shows that the increase in carbon dioxide gas leads to the gradual increase in the environmental temperature. Finally, the prediction clarifies that if no measures are taken presently, the climate change in Rwanda's Industrial zone will be dominated by warming periods in the future.","Climate change prediction, Internet of Things, MQTT, MongoDB, NodeRed",,ACM
A Timing-Based Framework for Designing Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems under Safety Constraint,"Al Maruf, Abdullah and Niu, Luyao and Clark, Andrew and Mertoguno, J. Sukarno and Poovendran, Radha",2023,Association for Computing Machinery,10.1145/3594638,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are required to satisfy safety constraints in various application domains such as robotics, industrial manufacturing systems, and power systems. Faults and cyber attacks have been shown to cause safety violations, which can damage the system and endanger human lives. Resilient architectures have been proposed to ensure safety of CPS under such faults and attacks via methodologies including redundancy and restarting from safe operating conditions. The existing resilient architectures for CPS utilize different mechanisms to guarantee safety, and currently, there is no common framework to compare them. Moreover, the analysis and design undertaken for CPS employing one architecture is not readily extendable to another. In this article, we propose a timing-based framework for CPS employing various resilient architectures and develop a common methodology for safety analysis and computation of control policies and design parameters. Using the insight that the cyber subsystem operates in one out of a finite number of statuses, we first develop a hybrid system model that captures CPS adopting any of these architectures. Based on the hybrid system, we formulate the problem of joint computation of control policies and associated timing parameters for CPS to satisfy a given safety constraint and derive sufficient conditions for the solution. Utilizing the derived conditions, we provide an algorithm to compute control policies and timing parameters relevant to the employed architecture. We also note that our solution can be applied to a wide class of CPS with polynomial dynamics and also allows incorporation of new architectures. We verify our proposed framework by performing a case study on adaptive cruise control of vehicles.","Safety-critical system, barrier certificate",,ACM

While there is a growing body of literature regarding ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is a need for more academic exploration of legal and regulatory best practice for autonomous systems used in commercial and defence contexts. This paper addresses that literature gap by considering the role of regulation and its relationship with trust in a multi-disciplinary context, before proposing 10 principles to base regulatory development and implementation on. These principles, Trust-centred; Collaborative; Risk-based; Evidence-led; Facilitate experimentation; Systems-focussed; Usable; Consistent; Adaptable and Reviewable, collectively provide a domain and technology agnostic basis for a regulatory framework development and implementation approach that supports the design, manufacture and operation of safe and trusted autonomous systems.

First, we construct the input embedding sequence as the model input. Second, the multichannel sensor data are adaptively fused using a convolutional layer. Then, the encoder encodes the signal based on global self-attention, which is representation learning. Finally, the decoupler iteratively generates decoupled labels. Two compound fault datasets are used, including the gearbox dataset and the bearing dataset, experiments on which show that the proposed method has higher accuracy, better generalization ability on the smaller training dataset, and stronger robustness against noise than CNN-based or MLP-based models.

How Should Enterprises Quantify and Analyze (Multi-Party) APT Cyber-Risk Exposure in their Industrial IoT Network?,"Ranjan Pal, R. Sequeira, Xinlong Yin, Sander Zeijlemaker, Vineeth Kotala",2023.0,ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems,10.1145/3605949,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks (e.g., a smart grid industrial control system) are increasingly on the rise, especially in smart cities around the globe. They contribute to meeting the day-to-day needs (e.g., power, water, manufacturing, transportation) of the civilian society, alongside making societal businesses more efficient, productive, and profitable. However, it is also well known that IoT devices often operate on poorly configured security settings. This increases the chances of occurrence of (nation-sponsored) stealthy spread-based APT malware attacks in IIoT networks that might go undetected over a considerable period of time. Such attacks usually generate a negative first-party QoS impact with financial consequences for companies owning such IIoT network infrastructures. This impact spans (i.e., aggregates) space (i.e., the entire IIoT network or a sub-network) and time (i.e., duration of business disruption), and is a measure of significant interest to managers running their businesses atop such networks. It is of little use to network resilience boosting managers if they have to wait for a cyber-attack to happen to gauge this impact. Consequently, one of the questions that intrigues us is: can managers estimate this first-party impact prior to APT cyber-attack(s) causing financial damage to companies? In this paper, we propose the first computationally efficient and quantitative network theory framework to (a) characterize this first-party impact apriori as a statistical distribution over multiple attack configurations in a family of malware-driven APT cyber-attacks specifically launched on businesses running atop IIoT networks, (b) accurately compute the statistical moments (e.g., mean) of the resulting impact distribution, and (c) tightly bound the accuracy of worst-case risk estimate of such a distribution - captured through the tail of the distribution, using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) metric. In relation to (a) above, our methodology extends the seminal Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) cyber-risk quantification methodology that does not explicitly account for network interconnections among system-risk contributing variables. We validate the effectiveness of our theory using trace-driven Monte Carlo simulations based upon test-bed experiments conducted in the FIT IoT-Lab. We further illustrate quantitatively that even if spread-based APT cyber-attacks induce a statistically light-tailed first-party cyber-loss distribution on an IIoT networked enterprise in the worst case, the aggregate multi-party cyber-risk distribution incurred by the same enterprise in supply-chain ecosystems could be heavy-tailed. This will pose significant market scale-up challenges to cyber-security improving commercial cyber (re-)insurance businesses. We subsequently propose managerial action items to mitigate the first-party cyber-risk exposure emanating from any given IIoT driven enterprise.",,1.0,Semantic Scholar

Fog-Assisted Dynamic IoT Device Access Management Using Attribute-Based Encryption,"Kasturi Routray, Padmalochan Bera",2024.0,International Conference of Distributed Computing and Networking,10.1145/3631461.3631466,"The management and control of heterogeneous IoT devices in cyber-physical systems (CPS) involves ensuring authorized access to cloud-stored data, including instructions, commands, and configuration settings, and issuing them securely to IoT devices for remote execution. Existing access management techniques present various security challenges in ensuring fine-grained access control to sensitive data present on untrusted cloud servers. These challenges are further complicated by the need to dynamically evaluate contextual parameters linked to IoT devices before issuing instructions. This work proposes a secure and context-aware encryption technique for remote access control of IoT devices. Leveraging ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), the scheme encrypts instructions, requiring the user’s decryption key to satisfy embedded access policies for access. The integration of access policies considers both user attributes and dynamic parameters associated with IoT devices, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation before access is granted. To verify the dynamic parameters, fog-based servers are employed, positioned in proximity to IoT devices for efficient and real-time assessment. The scheme introduces a two-phase decryption process, involving fog servers in generating key components based on the verified dynamic parameters (of IoT devices) that are combined with the user’s existing key to ensure secure partial decryption. Final decryption is performed by the user who securely sends instructions for execution on the IoT devices. Our proposed cryptosystem security and computational complexity analysis demonstrate the scheme’s effectiveness in achieving secure and context-aware IoT device access in dynamic CPS environments, ensuring efficient control, monitoring, and automation while preserving data privacy.",,4.0,Semantic Scholar

The computational requirements of this process can however be significant, which challenges its timely execution on IoT/edge devices where input date originate. To address this challenge, we present an architecture that allows the distributed execution of SMT problem solving workloads over the computing continuum as a service. Our design supports arbitrary hierarchies of solver nodes running anywhere from the IoT device to the cloud, each independently executing decision-making logic as to whether to solve an SMT problem instance locally or to recursively offload the task to other nodes in the continuum.

Static Analysis of BDI Agents on CPS using Petri Nets and MDE Techniques,"Karaduman, Burak and Tezel, Baris Tekin and Challenger, Moharram",2024,Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 27th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems,10.1145/3652620.3687819,"This paper introduces a method for the static analysis of belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents integrated with cyber-physical systems (CPS) using Petri nets (PN) and Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques, especially for their communication. CPS integrates computational and physical elements that need verification to ensure correct and safe operations before deploying BDI agents. The BDI agents provide intelligent behaviour in CPS, while PN provides a framework for analyzing these behaviours. By simulating PN, the operation of BDI agents can be analysed statically before deployment on CPS. In this regard, MDE enables the transformation of the semantic space of BDI agents into PN. Due to the BDI model's high-level abstraction, high-level expressiveness, such as Colored Petri nets (CPN), is required to detect undesired execution paths within the agent or from another agent via messaging. This process applies the Jason BDI AgentSpeak codes translation into a CPN model. This mapping paves the way to verify reachability, boundedness, and deadlock properties. Additionally, a case study is presented to illustrate the method's applicability. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with multiple agents communicating via a specific messaging structure.","coloured petri nets, BDI agents analysis, reachability, boundedness, deadlock, cyber-physical systems",,ACM

LLMEffiChecker: Understanding and Testing Efficiency Degradation of Large Language Models,"Feng, Xiaoning and Han, Xiaohong and Chen, Simin and Yang, Wei",2024,Association for Computing Machinery,10.1145/3664812,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have received much recent attention due to their human-level accuracy. While existing works mostly focus on either improving accuracy or testing accuracy robustness, the computation efficiency of LLMs, which is of paramount importance due to often vast generation demands and real-time requirements, has surprisingly received little attention. In this article, we make the first attempt to understand and test potential computation efficiency robustness in state-of-the-art LLMs. By analyzing the working mechanism and implementation of 20,543 public-accessible LLMs, we observe a fundamental property in LLMs that could be manipulated in an adversarial manner to reduce computation efficiency significantly. Our interesting observation is that the output length determines the computation efficiency of LLMs instead of the input, where the output length depends on two factors: an often sufficiently large yet pessimistic pre-configured threshold controlling the max number of iterations and a runtime-generated end of sentence (EOS) token. Our key motivation is to generate test inputs that could sufficiently delay the generation of EOS such that LLMs would have to go through enough iterations to satisfy the pre-configured threshold. We present LLMEffiChecker, which can work under both white-box setting and black-box setting. In the white-box scenario, LLMEffiChecker develops a gradient-guided technique that searches for a minimal and unnoticeable perturbation at character-level, token-level, and structure-level. In the black-box scenario, LLMEffiChecker employs a causal inference-based approach to find critical tokens and similarly applies three levels of imperceptible perturbation to them. Both the white-box and black-box settings effectively delay the appearance of EOS, compelling these inputs to reach the naturally unreachable threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMEffiChecker, we conduct a systematic evaluation on nine publicly available LLMs: Google T5, AllenAI WMT14, Helsinki-NLP translator, Facebook FairSeq, UNICAMP-DL translator, MarianMT, Google FLAN-T5, MBZUAI LaMini-GPT, and Salesforce CodeGen. Experimental results show that LLMEffiChecker can increase on average LLMs’ response latency and energy consumption by 325% to 3,244% and 344% to 3,616%, respectively, by perturbing just one character or token in the input sentence. Our case study shows that inputs generated by LLMEffiChecker significantly affect the battery power in real-world mobile devices (i.e., drain more than 30 times battery power than normal inputs).","Machine learning, software testing, large language model",,ACM

Given the advancements of paradigms such as the Internet of Things, along with the advancements of technologies such as Machine Learning and Digital Twins, DISs are on the rise. These systems are increasingly integrating components that perform intelligent functions, and these intelligent functions are increasingly heterogeneous and varied. Moreover, there is no standardized framework to help researchers and practitioners adequately address DISs. As a result, the complexity, interoperability issues, and development time and costs of these systems are growing. However, Model-Driven Development (MDD) can help to address these challenges by providing a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for developing DISs. In this work, a DSL for the design, validation, generation, and deployment of DISs is proposed. Firstly, the proposed DSL captures in a metamodel the key and high-level abstract concepts of the distinct DISs documented in the literature. Then, it allows modeling of DISs conforming to this metamodel. Subsequently, the DSL enables formal validation of the modeled systems. Lastly, it allows the generation and deployment of all DISs into production. Therefore, the work undertaken in this communication provides a methodological, formal, and standardized approach to defining and developing DISs from a high level of abstraction. This work allows users to address DISs by facilitating agility, minimizing manual tasks, and reducing the number of defects introduced in their development. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed DSL, a real case study of an agricultural digital twin is presented.","Distributed intelligent system, model-driven development, model-to- text transformation, Internet of Things, digital twin",,ACM

However, there is no consensus on the quality characteristics and subcharacteristics of embedded software. This article presents the steps for modeling an operational quality model for embedded software aligned with the ISO 25000 series of quality models for traditional computer systems. From a literature review composed of 40 studies on quality modeling for embedded systems and software, 85 of the most frequent quality characteristics and subcharacteristics were first identified, including a subset of 16 referenced or cited in at least 25% of the literature. Next, the design of a quality model for embedded software aligned with the ISO 25000 series was proposed with 13 characteristics and 27 subcharacteristics. The operational aspect of this quality model for embedded software is addressed next through a set of measures and measurement functions from ISO 25000 to aggregate the results of the quantification of the characteristics and subcharacteristics. A survey involving 25 embedded software specialists is presented next to gauge, using Fleiss's Kappa criteria, their agreement with the proposed quality model. Furthermore, the computed importance weights derived from the survey participants’ individual opinions were compared with those derived from an analysis of 40 embedded software studies, bolstering the credibility of the model. The results of this study suggest that the proposed quality model can serve as a framework for evaluating and understanding the quality characteristics across diverse expertise levels.

In this paper, we investigate the cellular association trace synthesis (CATS) problem, aiming to generate diverse and realistic cellular association traces based on road segment-based trajectories and corresponding departure times. To substantiate our research, we first gather substantial data, including road segment-based trajectories, base station (BS) distribution, and ground truths of cellular association traces. We then perform systematic data analysis to reveal technical challenges such as disparity in geographic spaces, complex and dynamic BS handover, and poor performance of single-dimension approaches. To address these challenges, we propose SynthCAT, a novel scheme that fuses model-based and data-driven approaches. Specifically, SynthCAT includes: i) A model-based coarse-grained cellular association trace generation component, encompassing GPS reference generation, weighted historical average time generation, Bayesian decision, and time mapping modules. This component establishes a unified GPS space to map road and BS spaces, generates initial time information, synthesizes coarse-grained spatial cellular association traces by following explicit BS handover rules, and maps the corresponding arrival time for each trace point; ii) A fine-grained cellular association trace generation component, which combines model-based and data-driven approaches. This employs a two-stage Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network (AEGAN) to refine cellular association traces based on the coarse-grained ones.

First, pattern quality is optimized by maximizing both, pattern size in terms of how many alerts are covered by a single pattern occurrence and pattern confidence taking into consideration how many alert occurrences are covered by repeated pattern occurrences, thus allowing for a two-dimensional flood reduction. Secondly, pattern coverage is maximized, ensuring that each alert occurrence is pinned down within a pattern and at the same time allowing for various patterns to be identified for a single alert, thus facilitating a multi-faceted flood reduction.

Malware Cyber Threat Intelligence System for Internet of Things (IoT) Using Machine Learning,Peng Xiao,,Journal of Cyber Security and Mobility,10.13052/jcsm2245-1439.1313,"<jats:p>Cyber Intelligence (CI) is a sophisticated security solution that uses machine learning models to protect networks against cyber-attack. Security concerns to IoT devices are exacerbated because of their inherent weaknesses in memory systems, physical and online interfaces, and network services. IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks because of the communication channels. That raises the risk of spoofing and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the entire system, which is a severe problem. Since the IoT ecosystem does not have encryption and access restrictions, cloud-based communications and data storage have become increasingly popular. An IoT-based Cyber Threat Intelligence System (IoT-CTIS) is designed in this article to detect malware and security threads using a machine learning algorithm. Because hackers are continuously attempting to get their hands on sensitive information, it is important that IoT devices have strong authentication measures in place. Multifactor authentication, digital certificates, and biometrics are just some of the methods that may be used to verify the identity of an Internet of Things device. All devices use Machine Learning (ML) assisted Logistic Regression (LR) techniques to address memory and Internet interface vulnerabilities. System integrity concerns, such as spoofing and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, must be minimized using the Random Forest (RF) Algorithm. Default passwords are often provided with IoT devices, and many users don’t bother to change them, making it simple for cybercriminals to get access. In other instances, people design insecure passwords that are easy to crack. The results of the experiments show that the method outperforms other similar strategies in terms of identification and wrong alarms. Checking your alarm system’s functionality both locally and in terms of its connection to the monitoring centre is why you do it. Make sure your alarm system is working properly by checking it on a regular basis. It is recommended that you do system tests at least once every three months. The experimental analysis of IoT-CTIS outperforms the method in terms of accuracy (90%), precision (90%), F-measure (88%), Re-call (90%), RMSE (15%), MSE (5%), TPR (89%), TNR (8%), FRP (89%), FNR (8%), Security (93%), MCC (92%).</jats:p>",,,CrossRef

It also introduces new attack surfaces that are a boon to attackers. The recent Mirai botnet showed the potential and power of a collection of compromised IoT devices. A new botnet, known as Hajime, targets many of the same devices as Mirai, but differs considerably in its design and operation. Hajime uses a public peer-to-peer system as its command and control infrastructure, and regularly introduces new exploits, thereby increasing its resilience. We show that Hajime’s distributed design makes it a valuable tool for better understanding IoT botnets. For instance, Hajime cleanly separates its bots into different peer groups depending on their underlying hardware architecture. Through detailed measurement—active scanning of Hajime’s peer-to-peer infrastructure and passive, longitudinal collection of root DNS backscatter traffic—we show that Hajime can be used as a lens into how IoT botnets operate, what kinds of devices they compromise, and what countries are more (or less) susceptible. Our results show that there are more compromised IoT devices than previously reported; that these devices use an assortment of CPU architectures, the popularity of which varies widely by country; that churn is high among IoT devices; and that new exploits can quickly and drastically increase the size and power of IoT botnets.

Prevention and monitoring measures can reduce the risk brought by cyber attacks, but the residual risk can still be unacceptably high in critical infrastructures or services. Resilience - i.e., the ability of a system to withstand adverse events while maintaining an acceptable functionality - is therefore a key property for such systems. In our research, we seek a model-free, quantitative, and general-purpose evaluation methodology to extract resilience indexes from, e.g., system logs and process data. While a number of resilience metrics have already been put forward, little experimental evidence is available when it comes to the cyber security of CPSs. By using the model of a real wastewater treatment plant, and simulating attacks that tamper with a critical feedback control loop, we provide a comparison between four resilience indexes selected through a thorough literature review involving over 40 papers. Our results show that the selected indexes differ in terms of behavior and sensitivity with respect to specific attacks, but they can all summarize and extract meaningful information from bulky system logs. Our evaluation includes an approach for extracting performance indicators from observed variables which does not require knowledge of system dynamics; and a discussion about combining resilience indexes into a single system-wide measure is included. 11The authors wish to thank Leonardo S.p.A. for its financial support.

We derive Nash Equilibrium conditions for the cases of interdependent and independent systems of systems under sum-form utility functions. We derive expressions for the infrastructure survival probability that capture its dependence on cost and system parameters, and also on dependencies that are specified by conditional probabilities.

CAROL: Confidence-Aware Resilience Model for Edge Federations,"Shreshth Tuli, G. Casale, N.

The requirement of supporting both latency-sensitive and compute-intensive IoT tasks necessitates service resilience, especially for the broker nodes in typical broker-worker deployment designs. Existing fault-tolerance or resilience schemes often lack robustness and generalization capability in non-stationary workload settings. This is typically due to the expensive periodic fine-tuning of models required to adapt them in dynamic scenarios. To address this, we present a confidence aware resilience model, CAROL, that utilizes a memory-efficient generative neural network to predict the Quality of Service (QoS) for a future state and a confidence score for each prediction. Thus, whenever a broker fails, we quickly recover the system by executing a local-search over the broker-worker topology space and optimize future QoS. The confidence score enables us to keep track of the prediction performance and run parsimonious neural network fine-tuning to avoid excessive overheads, further improving the QoS of the system. Experiments on a Raspberry-Pi based edge testbed with IoT benchmark applications show that CAROL outperforms state-of-the-art resilience schemes by reducing the energy consumption, deadline violation rates and resilience overheads by up to 16, 17 and 36 percent, respectively.",,8.0,Semantic Scholar

Such a property is of fundamental importance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and yet, to date, there is no widely agreed-upon formal treatment of CPS resiliency. We present an STL-based framework for reasoning about resiliency in CPS in which resiliency has a syntactic characterization in the form of an STL-based Resiliency Specification (SRS). Given an arbitrary STL formula $\varphi$, time bounds $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the SRS of $\varphi$, $R_{\alpha,\beta}(\varphi)$, is the STL formula $\neg\varphi\mathbf{U}_{[0,\alpha]}\mathbf{G}_{[0,\beta)}\varphi$, specifying that recovery from a violation of $\varphi$ occur within time $\alpha$ (recoverability), and subsequently that $\varphi$ be maintained for duration $\beta$ (durability). These $R$-expressions, which are atoms in our SRS logic, can be combined using STL operators, allowing one to express composite resiliency specifications, e.g., multiple SRSs must hold simultaneously, or the system must eventually be resilient. We define a quantitative semantics for SRSs in the form of a Resilience Satisfaction Value (ReSV) function $r$ and prove its soundness and completeness w.r.t. STL's Boolean semantics. The $r$-value for $R_{\alpha,\beta}(\varphi)$ atoms is a singleton set containing a pair quantifying recoverability and durability. The $r$-value for a composite SRS formula results in a set of non-dominated recoverability-durability pairs, given that the ReSVs of subformulas might not be directly comparable (e.g., one subformula has superior durability but worse recoverability than another). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-dimensional quantitative semantics for an STL-based logic.

Machine Learning-Enhanced Hybrid Source Location Privacy Protocol for Improved Security and Network Longevity in IoT Networks,"Mrs. Neha Gharat, Dr. Lochan Jolly",2025.0,Journal of Information Systems Engineering & Management,10.52783/jisem.v10i9s.1250,"Efficient routing in IoT networks is critical for optimizing data transmission while addressing the inherent challenges of energy consumption, scalability, and resilience. Common routing techniques, such as flooding, tree-based, cluster-based, and geographic routing, each present unique advantages and limitations regarding energy efficiency, network congestion, and fault tolerance. In parallel, source location privacy protection (SLPP) has emerged as a pivotal concern in IoT applications like surveillance and environmental monitoring, where adversaries may exploit transmission patterns to identify sensitive source nodes. Despite advancements, current issues in SLP in IoT networks include balancing privacy with energy efficiency, ensuring scalability in dense network environments, and providing resilience against increasingly sophisticated adversarial models. Traditional SLP techniques, including phantom routing, random walks, and dummy packet generation, often impose trade-offs between privacy, energy consumption, and network longevity, limiting their practical application in large-scale IoT networks. Additionally, many existing protocols struggle with adapting to dynamic network topologies and fail to adequately address the challenges posed by hotspot formation, which can lead to uneven energy depletion and compromised privacy. Many SLP methods disrupt the Quality of Service (QoS) by introducing delays or reducing throughput, which can hinder the primary functions of IoT applications, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios. A new Hybrid Source Location Privacy (SLP) protocol that effectively integrates random walks, rumor routing, and Greedy Random Walks to obscure source node locations while optimizing energy consumption is implemented to overcome these limitations. The protocol employs a multi-layer grid framework, dynamic cluster head rotations, and phantom nodes to balance energy usage and reduce network hotspots. The new Hybrid SLP confuses adversaries by combining fake packet generation with adaptive routing strategies, enhancing privacy without compromising network performance. Simulations demonstrate that the Hybrid SLP protocol significantly outperforms existing techniques, achieving lower energy consumption, extended network lifetime, and robust privacy protections, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive IoT applications. The proposed Hybrid SLP protocol integrates a machine learning-based anomaly detection system to enhance its performance and security, highlighting the novelty of the proposed work.

Current protocols often fail to balance the need for strong security with the resource limitations of IoT devices, leaving systems vulnerable to attacks like session hijacking, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle (MitM) breaches. To address this, we propose the Elliptic Curve-Based Mutual Authentication Protocol (EC-MAP), a lightweight solution tailored for resource-constrained IoT devices that require secure cloud interactions. EC-MAP combines elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)—using efficient 256-bit keys for robust security with low computational overhead—and hash-based message authentication (HMAC-SHA256) to enable mutual authentication, forward secrecy, and resistance to replay attacks. The protocol operates in three streamlined phases (initialization, handshake, and dynamic key renewal) and employs ephemeral keys and nonce-based challenges to minimize vulnerabilities. Evaluated through NS-3 simulations and formal verification with AVISPA, EC-MAP reduced authentication latency by 35% and energy consumption by 28% compared to Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and RSA-based approaches, while adhering to NIST IoT security standards. Results confirm its resilience against common attacks, scalability for large networks, and suitability for low-power devices.

These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable.

An IoT system consists of many wireless devices and a base station (gateway) and is designed to collect multiple pieces of useful information. Each IoT device transmits signals periodically at regular intervals and is equipped with a low-cost oscillator. In previous work, using computer simulation, we have shown that collisions occur between packets transmitted by the IoT devices, as a result of the poor frequency stability caused by the cheap oscillator. Moreover, we have previously proposed an algorithm that enables an IoT device to modify its communication cycle: a regular packet transmission is delayed by predicting the interval between received packets at a gateway. However, packets from the device whose transmission timing is modified collide with the following packets from other IoT devices, and the total number of modifications is greatly increased by this algorithm. The work reported in this paper aims to suppress packet collisions more effectively than the previous algorithm. The performance of the new algorithm is confirmed by simulation.",,,IEEE

"Symbiotic Use of Digital Twin, Simulation and Design Thinking Approach for Resilient Enterprise","Barat, Souvik and Lobo, Sylvan and Korabu, Reshma and Thogaru, Himabindu and Mahamuni, Ravi",2024,Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference,,"Enterprises are increasingly facing the need to be resilient in the face of uncertainty and dynamism. Simulatable digital twins have become critical aids for analyzing and adapting complex systems. Design thinking and service design methodologies, in contrast, are gaining momentum for ideation, subjective evaluation, and innovation. A systematic application of these methodologies to explore innovative ideas and a faithful virtual environment to test and fine-tune those ideas without impacting real systems could be transformational. This paper presents an approach that establishes a symbiotic relationship between these two approaches to introduce precision and innovativeness to make enterprises resilient. We describe the key characteristics of resilient enterprises, present our approach, and illustrate its effectiveness with a case study focusing on a transformation toward a new normal to address the Covid-19 pandemic induced disruptions in the IT industry.",,,ACM
"Tools, Capabilities and Experience of Digital Twins at the Mitre Corporation","Hua, Edward Y. and Cline, Jon and Wittman, Robert and Pires, Bianica",2025,Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference,,"The technology of Digital Twin (DT) engineering is increasingly being leveraged in industry for a wide range of applications. More recently, many departments in the U.S. government are exploring the use of DT to support their respective mission mandates. The MITRE Corporation, as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), is actively developing DT tools and capabilities to meet the needs of its government customers. While more people are becoming familiar with the term ""Digital Twin,"" not everyone has a clear understanding of what it is, and how it is implemented in different applications. In this paper, we present some of these DT tools and capabilities, as well as some MITRE projects that have benefitted from the DT toolset. Additionally, we discuss several nascent areas where DT may bring greater value to MITRE customers.",,,ACM
Towards metrics-driven adaptive security management in e-health IoT applications,"Savola, Reijo M. and Abie, Habtamu and Sihvonen, Markus",2012,Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Body Area Networks,,"E-health applications utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) technologies hold a significant promise: biomedical sensor networks and the appropriate interpretation of the data originating from them enable better self-care of chronic diseases, and thus are potential to imply remarkable savings in national healthcare budgets. However, security is a major concern in these applications due to varying use context, changing threats and the high privacy and confidentiality requirements of healthcare data. Novel adaptive security management solutions, based on security effectiveness, correctness and efficiency evidence, can be used to respond to these needs. We analyze security objectives of E-health IoT applications and their adaptive security decision-making needs, and propose a high-level adaptive security management mechanism based on security metrics to cope with the challenges.","IoT, adaptive security, security metrics",,ACM
Understanding Stakeholder Requirements for Digital Twins in Manufacturing Maintenance,"Chen, Siyuan and S\'{a}nchez, Juan Pablo Gonz\'{a}lez and Bekar, Ebru Turanoglu and Bokrantz, Jon and Skoogh, Anders and Lopes, Paulo Victor",2024,Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference,,"Digital twin has emerged as a key technology in the era of smart manufacturing and holds significant potential for maintenance. However, gaps remain in understanding stakeholders' requirements and how this technology support maintenance-related decisions. This paper aims to identify stakeholders' requirements for digital twin implementation and examine the role of digital twin in supporting maintenance actions and decision-making process. Semi-structured interviews and a workshop involving manufacturing practitioners and researchers were conducted to attain these goals. Furthermore, an in-depth qualitative analysis of the interview data was carried out. The results shed light on the current state of digital twin adoption, implementation challenges, requirements, supported decisions and actions, and future demand characteristics. By integrating the findings from the literature review and interview analysis, this study outlines the requirements for the digital twins as expressed by industry stakeholders that will be used and tested in the drone factory digital twin model.",,,ACM
Validation of Digital Twins: Challenges and Opportunities,"Hua, Edward Y. and Lazarova-Molnar, Sanja and Francis, Deena P.",2023,Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference,,"Digital twins enjoy increasing interest in a diverse array of industrial sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, urban planning, etc. Their usefulness depends on the robustness of the corresponding digital twin models; however, validation of the model, as a mean to ensure models' robustness, is a difficult problem. Moreover, traditional validation approaches need to undergo significant transformation to be made applicable to digital twins. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a systematic treatment of validating digital twin models. This paper identifies several challenges facing the model validation within digital twins. Furthermore, we propose an initial framework to define basic rules of digital twin model validation and introduce a systematic approach to validation that seamlessly combines expert knowledge and data gathered from available Internet of Things (IoT) devices.",,,ACM
Web tasking: a position paper,"Ng, Joanna W.",2014,Proceedings of 24th Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering,,"A major breakthrough in the web would be to enable web users the freedom to task, with resources from across the web, the same way they browse. Mashup, REST service composition, IFTTT and others have made some contribution to that effect. However, none of them is sufficient for web users' everyday use. I present a resource-oriented solution to this problem by introducing a RESTful representation of resources' actions. Using a web tasker, like the browser counterpart, users can express their tasks by selecting resource and its action. They can also specify conditions for executions as well as sequences of resource actions as hypermedia links of actions. Captured by a specialized media type, such instances of web tasking can be processed and executed by machine as an approach for resource oriented web automation as well as resource oriented web agents.","web tasking, web services, web automation, web agents, personal web tasking, mash up, end user programming, RESTful architecture",,ACM
