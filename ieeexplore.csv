This increases the need for an automated and secure onboarding procedure for IoT devices, systems and services. Device manufacturers are entering the market with internet connected devices, ranging from small sensors to production devices, which are subject of security threats specific to IoT. The onboarding procedure is required to introduce a new device in a System of Systems (SoS) without compromising the already onboarded devices and the underlying infrastructure. Onboarding is the process of providing access to the network and registering the components for the first time in an IoT/SoS framework, thus creating a chain of trust from the hardware device to its hosted software systems and their provided services. The large number and diversity of device hardware, software systems and running services raises the challenge to establish a generic onboarding procedure. In this paper, we present an automated and secure onboarding procedure for SoS. We have implemented the onboarding procedure in the Eclipse Arrowhead framework. However, it can be easily adapted for other IoT/SoS frameworks that are based on Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) principles. The automated onboarding procedure ensures a secure and trusted communication between the new IoT devices and the Eclipse Arrowhead framework. We show its application in a smart charging use case and perform a security assessment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3102280","European Union (EU) Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership (ECSEL) Joint Undertaking(grant numbers:737459); Productive4.0 Project(grant numbers:826452); Arrowhead Tools project; Investitionen in Wachstum und Beschäftigung–Europäischer Fonds für regionale Entwicklung (IWB-EFRE) (2014-2020), Measurement of IT-Security in Industry (MIT) 4.0 (FE02) Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9505607","Internet of Things;System of Systems;Service-oriented Architecture;secure onboarding","Security;Internet of Things;System of systems;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Hardware;Computer architecture","","10","","52","CCBY","3 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We design such architecture to be service oriented and to provide interactions between each established constituent system (CS), which is composed by the following elements: 1) local IoE modules; 2) CS negotiator agent; and 3) IoE/IoA agent. We consider a case study about interschool collaborations to improve learning in biology classes. Our results indicate that the usage of the IoA network improves on 52.02% the performance of the IoE network, it improves the recommendation of services by establishing a high competition between CSs, and quadruplicates the number of connections in this SoS network.

These systems are critical to ensure the quality of production and the safety of persons working at the shop floor level. Furthermore, this situation is similar in other domains, such as logistics that, in turn, are connected and affect the overall production efficiency. In this context, this article presents some key steps for integrating three pillars of CPS (production line, logistics and facilities) into the current smart manufacturing environments in order to adopt an industrial Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) paradigm. The approach is focused on the integration in several digital functionalities in a cloud-based platform to allow a real time multiple devices interaction, data analytics/sharing and machine learning-based global reconfiguration to increase the management and optimization capabilities for increasing the quality of facility services, safety and energy efficiency and industrial productivity. Conceptually, isolated systems may enhance their capabilities by accessing to information of other systems. The approach introduces particular vision, main components, potential and challenges of the envisioned CPSoS. In addition, the description of one scenario for realizing the CPSoS vision is presented.

Thus, interoperability approaches that are based on standardization and symbolic inference will have limited generalization and scalability in the SoS engineering domain. We present simulation experiments performed with message data generated using heating and ventilation system simulations. While the unsupervised learning approach proposed here remains unsolved in general, we obtained up to 75% translation accuracy with autoencoders aligned by back-translation after investigating seven different models with different training protocols and hyperparameters. For comparison, we obtain 100% translation accuracy on the same task with supervised learning, but the need for a labeled dataset makes that approach less interesting.

We advocate that to efficiently integrate CPSs within the CPSoS, we may need to adjust the autonomy of some CPSs in a way that allows them to coordinate their activities to avoid any potential conflict among one another. To achieve that, we need to incorporate the notion of governance within the design of CPSoS, which defines rules that can be used for clearly specifying who and how can adjust the autonomy of a CPS. In this paper, we try to tackle this problem by proposing a new conceptual model that can be used for performing a governance-based analysis of autonomy for CPSs within CPSoS.

While the complexity of these Systems of Systems (SoSs) is constantly rising, requirements engineering before actual implementing the system becomes increasingly difficult. Thus, comprehensive frameworks providing a foundation for model-based systems engineering, like the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) or the Software Platform Embedded Systems (SPES), have been introduced. Although providing a standardized methodology, missing formalizations impede the modeling of systems according to detailed architectural specifications. To address these issues, this paper introduces an approach for eliciting, specifying and managing requirements according to a particular process and aligned to architectural standards.

Therefore, a cyber-physical security system against different kinds of attacks is in high demand. Traditionally, attacks are detected via monitoring system logs. However, the system logs, such as network statistics and file access records, can be forged. Furthermore, existing solutions mainly target cyber attacks. This paper proposes the first energy auditing and analytics-based IoT monitoring mechanism. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to detect and identify IoT cyber and physical attacks based on energy auditing. Using the energy meter readings, we develop a dual deep learning (DL) model system, which adaptively learns the system behaviors in a normal condition. Unlike the previous single DL models for energy disaggregation, we propose a disaggregation-aggregation architecture. The innovative design makes it possible to detect both cyber and physical attacks. The disaggregation model analyzes the energy consumptions of system subcomponents, e.g., CPU, network, disk, etc., to identify cyber attacks, while the aggregation model detects the physical attacks by characterizing the difference between the measured power consumption and prediction results. Using energy consumption data only, the proposed system identifies both cyber and physical attacks. The system and algorithm designs are described in detail. In the hardware simulation experiments, the proposed system exhibits promising performances.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2899492","Southern Company; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8642398","Cyber and physical attack detection;deep learning (DL);energy audit;Internet of Things (IoT)","Internet of Things;Deep learning;Power demand;Measurement;Cyberattack;Energy consumption","","88","","34","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our research team proposes a cyber-physical system that monitors the quality of service of the transit bus system around James Madison University (JMU), located in Harrisonburg, Virginia, USA. By utilizing the power of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as Raspberry Pi computing devices, it is possible to create a network of smart nodes that collect data on the bus routing efficiency and ridership. Using the collected data and using big data analysis, improvements can be made to bus route efficiency and traffic congestion in Harrisonburg, as well as similar college towns. This paper presents data analysis for the first deployment of the IoT nodes at seven JMU bus shelters, during the Spring 2017. Data stations compile and submit the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and timestamps of wireless devices surrounding the bus stations. This information is stored in a Cloud Storage database that allows for big data analysis and convenient access. In this paper we present the usage of the data collected, modifications to improve both the transit system as well as the data collection methods for future node deployments. Our results show the average passenger waiting times at a sample of the seven bus stations. Route optimization and dynamic changes for the route are discussed. Also, we discuss several concerns on security and privacy related to the collection, transmission, and storage of data in the Cloud (e.g., privacy of the ridership MAC addresses, tracking of a specific bus rider in the system ...etc.).

Main obstacles to achieving self-adaptive CPSoS are time constraints and system anomalies. An adaptation should be processed within a certain period and it should consider anomalies caused by system changes due to mechanical faults, cyber-attacks, or emergent behaviors. However, since existing adaptation approaches cannot fully handle both aspects, this paper proposes an advanced approach, A4, for a self-adaptive system that can handle known anomalies in runtime. This approach learns the known anomalies before runtime and mitigates their impact when they are detected.

The increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. This paper summarizes the state of the art of existing work on anomaly detection, fault-tolerance, and self-healing, and adds a number of other methods applicable to achieve resilience in an IoT. We particularly focus on non-intrusive methods ensuring data integrity in the network. Furthermore, this paper presents the main challenges in building a resilient IoT for the CPS, which is crucial in the era of smart CPS with enhanced connectivity (an excellent example of such a system is connected autonomous vehicles).

In this paper we focus on smart cyber-physical systems, such as those based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Such smart systems aim to intelligently automate a variety of functions, with the goal of hiding that complexity from the user. Furthermore, the interactions of the user with such systems are more often implicit than explicit, for instance, a pedestrian with wearables walking through a smart city environment will most likely interact with the smart environment implicitly through a variety of inferred preferences based on previously provided or automatically collected data. The key question that we explore is that of empowering software engineers to pragmatically take into account how users make informed security choices about their data and information in such a pervasive environment. We discuss a range of existing frameworks considering the impact of automation on user behaviours and argue for the need of a shift-from usability to security ergonomics as a key requirement when designing and implementing security features in smart cyber-physical environments.

Since there are many combinations of devices and software in the network, designing and testing systems cannot be done manually as with current CPS. The system model and technologies suitable for Open IoT are necessary. In this article, we propose a new concept of CPS. It is “Ephemeral-Cyber-Physical System (E-CPS),” which is temporarily constructed by combining devices in the network similar to an instance of cloud computing. Also, we propose a method of actuator control optimization for automatically constructing E-CPS by using nonconfigured devices connected to the network. This method will significantly contribute to not only E-CPS but also quick and inexpensive provision of conventional CPS. Experiments with a simulator, and with lighting devices and cameras confirmed that the method can automatically optimize the actuator control value and it enables satisfying the service requirements at a low cost.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2950719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970588","Actuator;cyber-physical system (CPS);Internet of Things (IoTs);network;sensor","Robot sensing systems;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Software;Actuators;Cameras","","8","","45","CCBY","27 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These advancements have enabled more precise tracking, better communication capabilities, and enhanced control over vehicle operations. Despite these improvements, there remains a persistent need for systems that are not only reliable but also incorporate multiple layers of security to prevent unauthorized access and use. This research paper introduces GPS and GSM based tracking system designed to significantly enhance vehicle safety and provide real time location monitoring. The system utilizes an Arduino Uno as the primary control unit, interfaced with a GSM module (SIM800L) for communication and a GPS module (NEO-6M) for precise tracking of the vehicle's location. Key components include a relay-controlled ignition switch and a key lock system to manage vehicle startup, a fingerprint sensor for advanced biometric authentication, and a buzzer for auditory alerts. The entire system operates on a 9$V$ power supply, with voltage regulation managed by an LM2596 step-down converter. This integration of hardware components ensures robust vehicle tracking, remote control capabilities, and heightened security measures, thereby offering an effective solution for personal vehicle safety and efficient fleet management. In an average, for every 10 iterations we observed that 9 iterations are where successful, which shows that the efficiency was 90 % as there was delay in sending and receiving messages.","","979-8-3315-4066-1","10.1109/ICoICI62503.2024.10696765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10696765","Vehicle Tracking;Internet of Things (IoT);GPS;GSM;Fingerprint;Satellite;Two Factor Authentication","GSM;Vehicle safety;Authentication;Real-time systems;Hardware;Security;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Remote control;Global Positioning System","","","","15","IEEE","4 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the interplay of those Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) itself forms a System of Systems (SoS), engineering such a system becomes a difficult task. This is mainly attributed to the evolutionary development of its independently operating components, which results in some kind of unpredictable and often undesirable behavior. Considering this from a developer’s perspective, it is important to investigate the system’s behaviors before its actual implementation. However, as methods applied in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) have proven to be a major technology driver when it comes to developing the architecture of these industrial systems, their simulation is still not standardized. Thus, this paper introduces an Industry 4.0 specific tool-chain enabling the co-simulation of components within any developed industrial system architecture. This allows the investigation of varying industrial CPS and their interplay during run-time with the goal to detect undesired emergent behaviors. By doing so, the model is developed regarding the specifications of the Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), while Mosaik is the tool of choice for creating the Co-Simulation environment. In order to validate the developed tool-chain, a case study utilizing modular production units within an industrial automation system is applied.","2687-8828","978-1-6654-3168-2","10.1109/ISSE51541.2021.9582531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582531","System Architecture;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0);Industrial Systems Engineering;Co-Simulation","Industries;Systems architecture;Production;Tools;Cyber-physical systems;Modeling;Task analysis","","","","29","IEEE","28 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing edge computing solutions operate under the assumption that devices at the edge remain connected through a reliable edge network. While such systems bring enormous possibilities to first responders through new emergency response applications on handheld devices, they still suffer from poor inter-connectivity and, thus, remain ineffective.

In essence, blockchain supports a decentralized platform maintained by peers instead of a single entity. Furthermore, the data in the blockchain is immutable and is being held in a secure and encrypted way. However, running the blockchain on resource-limited devices, such as a consumer PC or a low-power Raspberry Pi as opposed to dedicated servers, is demanding due to the resource limitation in energy, memory, and time taken to validate the transaction on the blockchain. This paper explores these limitations by evaluating and benchmarking the blockchain framework Geth: a terminal interface for the Ethereum blockchain which makes it possible to create a private blockchain in addition to joining the actual blockchain. This article employs a private blockchain within Geth and benchmarks the blockchain to highlight the differences (and limitations) between the devices. Specifically, we make the following observations: (i) the time it takes to validate and add the transaction to the blockchain on a Raspberry Pi 4 is markedly slower compared to an Intel i9-10885H CPU @ 2.40GHz, (ii) the transaction between PCs compared to transactions between Pis is around two orders of magnitude higher.

Logistics and sustainment are traditionally brought into the IoT conversation through asset tracking, transportation, and Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS). However the IoT has additional aspects that can be related to logistics information systems and automated test. In relation to Automated Test Systems, the IoT can be a valuable component while an ATS may also use IoT concepts and capabilities within its own architecture. ATSs are applicable in all layers of the IoT: sensing, networking / communications, and applications. An ATS can be a sensor in the IoT serving to inform sustaining engineering, product support management, maintenance planning, and supply chain decisions through its test and diagnostic data. In addition, many ATSs consist of a network of instrumentation and measurement devices that can serve as part of the IoT network / communication layer. And finally an automated test and diagnostic application can be used in the IoT to expand the scale of testing beyond standard automated test capability. This paper describes and analyzes the implementation of Automated Test Systems in all three IoT layers. The described ATS / IoT interactions elicit multiple benefits and challenges. The ubiquity and diversity of sensors in the Internet of Things allows for a new scope of testing across an enterprise, correlation of asset usage and repair, supply chain prognostics, and opportunities for deep learning. Challenges inevitably include cybersecurity and the analysis of overwhelming data.

In addition, most existing eco-feedback systems focus on providing energy usage information and ignore the users' contexts. This may render the systems incapable of capturing the users' changes when proenvironmental behaviors have been encouraged. To address this, our study leverages Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies to realize an adaptive, context-aware, and playful cyber-physical system (CPS) for everyday energy savings with the hope of facilitating collaboration between a person and a smart energy-saving (ES) system to the greatest extent possible. To leverage the benefits inherent in a CPS, bidirectionally interactive information visualization integrated with pet-raising gamification was incorporated into the adaptive CPS. This synchronized the information from the user's physical environment with its counterpart in the pet's virtual environment. In order to provide flexible services, all IoT devices were agentized to form reconfigurable agents. In our experimental evaluation, this bidirectional mapping empowered users to flexibly control remote appliances anywhere and anytime in a more natural way, which enabled users to embed interactions with the ES CPS into their daily routine. Furthermore, improvements to system adaptability (33% in precision; 21% in recall) along with the reconfigurable ES services (additionally saving energy about 16.21%) show the potential of the CPS to enhance the users' experience and prolong the users' engagement in everyday energy savings.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2018.2844119","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 105-2221-E-011-087,MOST 106-2221-E-011-029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390704","Adaptation;context-awareness;cyber-physical system (CPS);energy savings;gamification-based eco-automation (mixed reality);Internet of Things (IoT)","Sensors;Internet of Things;Adaptive systems;Cyber-physical systems;Visualization;Biological system modeling;Actuators","","35","","29","IEEE","20 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Undoubtedly, the IoT paradigm will continue to impact human life by providing efficient control of the environment with minimum human intervention. However, despite the ubiquity of IoT devices in modern society, the dependability of IoT applications remains a crucial challenge. Accordingly, this paper systematically reviews the current status and challenges of IoT dependability frameworks. Based on the review, existing IoT dependability frameworks are mainly based on informal reliability models. These informal reliability models are unable to effectively evaluate the unified treatment safety faults and cyber-security threats of IoT systems. Additionally, the existing frameworks are also unable to deal with the conflicting interaction between co-located IoT devices and the dynamic features of self-adaptive, reconfigurable, and other autonomous IoT systems. To this end, this paper suggested the design of a novel model-based dependability framework for quantifying safety faults and cyber-security threats as well as interdependencies between safety and cyber-security in IoT ecosystems. Additionally, robust approaches dealing with conflicting interactions between co-located IoT systems and the dynamic behaviours of IoT systems in reconfigurable and other autonomous systems are required.","","978-1-6654-7095-7","10.1109/ICECCME55909.2022.9987845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9987845","Internet of Things;dependability analysis;safety;cyber-security;safety assurance;reconfigurable systems","Mechatronics;Automation;Autonomous systems;Biological system modeling;Ecosystems;Safety;Internet of Things","","8","","50","IEEE","30 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, vehicles must communicate with the surrounding environment to provide efficient driving features that prevent crashing and thus save passenger lives. However, the constant information exchange with the vicinity leads to growing attack surfaces of vehicles, which endangers the functional safety of vehicles in particular. Security-by-design seems to be a promising approach to overcoming security challenges and will become essential for the development of automotive architectures in the future. Therefore, the standard ISO-21434 was invented providing guidelines on how to tackle cybersecurity in the automotive context. One proposed method by this standard is the Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) process used for analyzing cybersecurity threats. Nevertheless, no tools or approaches exist that provide full automation of the TARA process from an ISO-21434 perspective. Therefore, this paper proposes a concept to automate the TARA method by combining the security pattern engineering process with the Automotive Reference Architecture Model (ARAM) to enable a multi-layered security-by-design approach for the development of secure system-of-systems (SoS) architectures in conformity with ISO-21434.","","978-953-290-128-3","10.23919/SpliTech58164.2023.10193084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10193084","Automotive Cybersecurity;Smart City;System-of-Systems;ISO-21434;Model-Based Systems Engineering;V2X;Cyber-Physical Systems","Smart cities;Safety;Risk management;Task analysis;Computer crime;Standards;Information exchange","","1","","22","","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Local problems are solved offline using multi-parametric optimization methods, whereas the coordination problem is solved online at every sampling step and the optimal solution is applied to the system at hand in a receding horizon fashion. The method solves the optimal control problem online iteratively while exploiting the control system structure. The efficiency of the method is tested on a number of generated distributed optimization problems modeling large systems of systems.","","978-953-233-095-3","10.23919/MIPRO.2018.8400168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8400168","model predictive control;systems of systems;multi-parametric optimization;alternating direction method of multipliers;coordination methods","Convex functions;Couplings;Cost function;Optimal control;System of systems","","","","9","","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The adequate performance of time-critical automation applications depends on a clock synchronization scheme used by control systems. Network packet delay variations adversely impact the clock synchronization performance. The impact is significant in industrial sites, where software and hardware resources heavily contribute to delay variations and where harsh environmental conditions interfere with communication network dynamics. While existing time synchronization methods for field IIoT end-devices, e.g., Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP), provide adequate synchronization in good operating conditions, their performance degrades significantly with deteriorating network conditions. To overcome this issue, we propose a scalable, software-based, lightweight clock synchronization method, called CoSiNeT, for IIoT end-devices that maintains precise synchronization performance in a wide range of operating conditions. We have conducted measurements in local network deployments such as home and a university campus in order to evaluate the proposed algorithm performance. The results show that CoSiNeT matches well with SNTP and state-of-the-art method in good network conditions in terms of accuracy and precision; however, it outperforms them in degrading network scenarios. In our measurements, in fair network conditions, CoSiNeT improves synchronization performance by 56% and 73% compared to SNTP and state-of-the-art method. In the case of poor network conditions, it improves performance by 76% and 74%, respectively.","","978-1-7281-6207-2","10.1109/ICPS49255.2021.9468174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468174","Clock Synchronization;Industrial Automation;Cyber-physical systems;Industrial internet of things;Wireless networks;SNTP;NTP;Round Trip Delay","Performance evaluation;Time-frequency analysis;Service robots;Cyber-physical systems;Software;Delays;Safety","","3","","11","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cyber-attacks directed at CPS may result in serious repercussions, such as bodily harm, monetary loss, or even fatality. As a result, in IoT-enabled CPS systems, there is an urgent need for reliable and effective detection mechanisms to recognize and neutralize cyber threats. This research proposes an integrated system for cyberattack detection in IoT-enabled CPS. The suggested system efficiently detects and addresses cyber threats by combining an anomaly detection technique with a decision tree. The CPS environment’s Internet of Things (IoT) devices constantly produce data streams on network traffic, sensor readings, and system operations. Gathering and preprocessing these data streams is to extract pertinent information for analysis. The system integrates principal component analysis (PCA) with deep neural networks (DNN) for intrusion detection and network traffic analysis to monitor and analyze communication patterns between IoT devices, servers, and external networks. At the network level, this aids in the identification of possible attack pathways and malicious activity. When a cyber-attack or anomaly is detected, the system initiates the proper reaction processes to lessen the effects and stop additional harm. It could entail notifying system administrators for human intervention, changing access rules, and isolating hacked devices. Finally, the proposed approach shows the significant impact of detecting cyberattacks from networking datasets.","","979-8-3503-6790-4","10.1109/ICECA63461.2024.10800946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10800946","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);Internet of Things (IoT);Cyber-Attacks;Principal Component Analysis (PCA);Deep Neural Network (DNN)","Systems operation;Artificial neural networks;Telecommunication traffic;Cyber-physical systems;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Security;Cyberattack;Streams;Principal component analysis","","","","18","IEEE","24 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such a SoS the subsystems will have to serve a dual purpose in a) the initial purpose that the subsystem was originally designed and deployed for, e.g., control and protection of the physical assets of a critical infrastructure system that could be up and running for 30-40 years, and b) at the same time provide information to a higher-level system for a potential future increase of system functionality as technology matures and/or new opportunities are provided by, e.g., greater analytics capabilities.

This work is modern manifestation of three laws of computing. Moore's and Koomey's laws recommend performance gain and energy efficiency whereas Metcalfe's law imply network scalability. Combination of these laws suggests the research proposition that development of scalable and performance efficient IoT networks is inevitable. Although IoT has improved specific logistics modules considerably, but incorporation of IoT in complete supply chain of food and random placement of IoT devices due to which unstable coverage and connectivity occurred are major challenges in logistics. The proposed SLCPS framework is designed firstly, to develop apt IoT protocol stack for logistics. Secondly, for bonded connectivity and coverage, mathematical models are proposed instead of random placement and coverage map is based on binary coverage model. Thirdly, for scalability supply chain of food for smart logistics process is designed in terms of container, storehouse and warehouse comprising of varying number of IoT devices.

However, most of those reference architectures look good on paper, but are missing practical applications, as this is also the case with the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). Therefore, in order to increase the usability of RAMI 4.0 in terms of its service-orientation, a detailed architecture definition of its Communication Layer is proposed in this paper.

Many systematic literature reviews (SLRs) were produced on this subject; however, two issues remain to be addressed: i) a reference taxonomy of the different aspects of IoT capabilities composition and decomposition is needed, and ii) many formal questions (e.g., standards role, formal representations applications, state-space explosion countermeasures, etc.), technical questions (e.g., composition process types and automation levels synergies, service decomposition categories, the role of AI/ML, etc.), and QoS questions (e.g., privacy, interoperability, and scalability challenges and solutions, etc.) remain unanswered. We introduce this work by discussing notions of IoT capabilities composition and decomposition in a layered IoT architecture while highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of existing SLRs. We identify unanswered questions through gaps in related work and motivate these questions using the PICOC methodology. We explain the search methodology and organize the topic questions using the proposed reference taxonomy. The identified research questions are answered, and trends and gaps that need additional attention from the research community are highlighted. This effort benefits city planners and end-users of IoT systems as it contributes to a better understanding of the role of composition and decomposition of IoT capabilities in building value-added services or reusing existing ones for resource optimization.

We have then proposed a theoretical framework for the IEnMS using IoT, big data and data analytics to construct an effective cyber-physical system architecture including steps from data acquisition to the end-user decision-making process.

To reduce the power consumption of such systems, we propose the use of a signal-dependent sampling method in a bottom-up fashion, which can lead to up to a 94% reduction in the overall system power with negligible or no loss in performance. Moreover, the proposed technique provides further flexibility for self-aware CPSs to dynamically adjust the number of data samples that are needed for processing (and consequently reduce the power consumption) based on the application at hand and the desired trade-off between accuracy and power consumption. To show the merits of the proposed approach, we also present case studies in the context of an Electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring system as well as a greenhouse (temperature and relative humidity) monitoring system. We also discuss the trade-offs among the system configuration parameters, power consumption, and performance (accuracy). We show that the proposed method has a negligible overhead, which facilitates the real-time operation of the IoT CPS while achieving significant power savings (up to 94%).

The perception layer provides a unique challenge for intrusion detection where resources are constrained and networks are distributed. An additional challenge is that IoT networks are a continuous non-stationary data stream that, due to their variable nature, are likely to experience concept drift. This research aimed to review the practical applications of online machine learning methods for IoT network intrusion detection, to answer the question if a resource efficient architecture can be provided?

The integration of these devices on a large scale can violate the technical and regulatory constraints of the smart power grid. Therefore, a proper control system must be designed to increase their power output and maximize the system owners’ benefit while meeting power grid standards. This paper is a collection of information to provide its reader with a holistic view of the implementation of a cyber-physical system to aid in distribution system planning. The goal of this paper is to review the current literature and identify research gaps that have yet to be fully explored. This is followed by making proposals for areas to be researched in order to improve the knowledge bank surrounding this important topic. This paper will begin by addressing the concept of a cyberphysical system by elaborating on its structure through its various layers. It will also describe the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in improving the monitoring and control abilities of cyber-physical distribution systems. Furthermore, a detailed literature review is given to highlight the current state of distribution system research being done surrounding the implementation of cyber-physical systems to improve system planning. Based on this review, an analysis is given to better explain how a successful cyber-physical based distribution system can be constructed to achieve automation.

Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software.

Innovation potential represents the convergence of three systems: the system of interest, the innovation system, and the context where these interact and come together. The three-system model is a useful perspective to assess the potential impact of innovation on the evolution of an SoS, and to describe the context of SoS emergence as enabled or constrained by its innovation system. We describe a set of methods and tools adapted from both SoS engineering and human-centered design which can be used for strategic design and planning of SoS evolution.

Observing the heterogeneity and resource constraints, we intend to make blockchain accommodate both wimpy and brawny IoT devices. In this article, we present Tornado, a high-performance blockchain system based on space-structured ledger and corresponding algorithms, to enable blockchain in IoT. Specifically, we first design a space-structured chain architecture with novel data structures for promoting the network scalability. To address the huge heterogeneity of IoT, a novel consensus mechanism named collaborative-proof of work is developed. Moreover, we propose the space-structured greedy heaviest-observed subtree (S2GHOST) protocol for improving the resource efficiency of IoT devices. Additionally, a dynamic weight assignment mechanism in S2GHOST contributes to reflect the trustworthiness of data and devices.

Blockchain is a potential solution to realizing CPS. It can provide data security and privacy through block hash generation and transaction validation schemes. Blockchain applications can enhance the performance of CPS through the peer-to-peer (P2P) communication mechanism.

Such devices, commonly called Internet of Things (IoT) devices, with sensing/actuation capabilities, are becoming capable of managing the complexity of communications over the Internet. Nevertheless, the IoT ecosystem is still fragmented due to the different used vertical solutions. This heterogeneity makes IoT devices/systems unable to communicate seamlessly, leading to limited cooperation and tightly coupled deployments. To deal with the interoperability issues in IoT, we propose, in this paper, a Cloud-based approach with a Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) mechanism enabling the IoT devices to communicate using the Representational state transfer (REST) model: an approach that follows the Web of things (WoT) paradigm. In particular, the system makes the IoT devices’ hosted resources (e.g., sensors and actuators) able to be steered using globally resolvable (over the Internet) Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) even when deployed behind Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls. The system we conceived requires only one public registered domain name to associate, for all the distributed IoT devices, sub-domains of the public one while using a clever routing mechanism. An online implementation of the testbed is provided to show the feasibility of the approach. Further, a performance evaluation of the system is reported to assess the resource usage of the solution.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2021.3110003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9531380","Internet of Things;cloud computing;Web of Things;REST;cyber physical systems;openstack;web services","Internet of Things;Web services;Protocols;Peer-to-peer computing;Web servers;Cloud computing;XML;Cyber-physical systems;Social factors","","7","","31","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to meet these needs, a promising computing system based on the integration of fog and cloud computing has been recently introduced. However, this system is still in its infancy and it is associated with many challenging issues. Task scheduling problem is one of the most important ones in this context. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a real-time randomized algorithm to address this problem in the large-scale fog-cloud computing systems. The proposed algorithm uses the Power of Two Choices (Po2C) approach to maximize QoS while minimizing monetary cost. The efficiency of the proposed Po2C is evaluated using extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline scheduling strategies. Specifically, our algorithm improves the deadline violation cost by up to 58% in comparison with the Round Robin strategy.","","978-1-7281-9611-4","10.1109/SCIOT50840.2020.9250197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9250197","Internet of Things (IoT);fog computing;cloud computing;task scheduling;power of two choices;Quality of Service (QoS);cost-efficient","Cloud computing;Smart cities;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Scheduling;Internet of Things;Task analysis","","10","","15","IEEE","10 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The device is an intrusion detection system related to legacy systems that is able to collect and reporting data to and from industrial IoT devices. It is based on the common signature based intrusion detection system developed in the information technology domain, however, to cope with the constraints of the operation technology domain, it exploits anomaly based features.

More recently, PSS that comprise System of Systems (SoS) have been of increasing interest, notably in the transportation (autonomous vehicle infrastructures, multi-modal transportation) and energy sector (smart grids). Architecting such PSS-SoS goes beyond classic SoS engineering, as they are often driven by new technology, without an a priori client and actor network, and thus, a much larger number of potential architectures. However, it seems that neither the existing PSS nor SoS literature provides solutions to how to architect such PSS. This paper presents a methodology for architecting PSS-SoS that are driven by technological innovation. The objective is to design PSS-SoS architectures together with their value proposition and business model from an initial technology impact assessment. For this purpose, we adapt approaches from the strategic management, business modeling, PSS and SoS architecting literature.

An important task of this procedure is to find ideas for new product features based on an existing reference product. In industrial practice, usually technical models of the reference product (e.g. CAD models) are employed in the scope of product feature ideation. However, these models alone do not provide sufficient information for the identification of new Internet of Things (IoT) features. These features require the consideration of the available flows, the utilized communication technologies, and the surrounding System of Systems (SoS). A potential solution for this problem is provided by Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). MBSE provides a holistic system model that describes the logical architecture as well as the environment of the reference product. However, there is a lack of methodological support for the utilization of system models in the scope of strategic product planning. This paper presents a novel method for IoT feature ideation based on the system model of a reference product. The core of this method is the so-called IoT canvas, which constitutes an IoT-specific view on the system model of the reference product. It can be systematically derived from the system model and serves as the starting point for product feature ideation. The presented method was evaluated in the scope of an innovation project with a German manufacturing company and showed high potential for industrial practice.","","978-1-5386-4876-6","10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428722","Model-Based Systems Engineering;Product Generation Engineering PGE;Cyber-Physical Systems CPS;Industry 4.0;Fuzzy front-end;Early phase of innovation process;Release planning;Innovation management;Advanced Systems Engineering;Workshop approach;Methodology;Product planning","Unified modeling language;Solid modeling;Planning;Production systems;Printing","","1","","27","IEEE","9 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One major challenge can be found in achieving a high level of security within such highly connected environments, in which an unpredictable number of heterogeneous systems with often-distinctive characteristics interact with each other. In order to develop high-level security solutions, system designers must eventually know the current level of security of their specification. To this end, security metrics and scoring frameworks are essential, as they quantitatively express security of a given design or system. However, existing solutions may not be able to handle the proposed challenges of CPS, as they mainly focus on one particular system and one specific attack. Therefore, we aim to elaborate a security scoring mechanism, which can efficiently be used in CPS, while considering all essential information. We break down each system within the CPS into its core functional blocks and analyze a variety of attacks in terms of exploitability, scalability of attacks, as well as potential harm to targeted assets. With this approach, we get an overall assessment of security for the whole CPS, as it integrates the security-state of all interacting systems.

These algorithms are under threat because of the emerging quantum computing paradigm: with quantum computing, these encryption algorithms can be potentially broken. It is therefore desirable to explore the use of quantum cryptography – which cannot be broken by quantum computing – for securing the classical communications infrastructure deployed in CPS. In this paper, we discuss possible consequences of this option.

While these “decision parameter”-focused approaches have been well accepted, they typically consider access control with centralized administration. Smart and collaborative computing systems (SCSs) such as online social networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and connected cyber-physical systems (CPSs) require a disparate approach to meet their unique and complex access control requirements primarily because there are multiple participants who create, share, manage and protect resources (e.g., files, smart devices) individually, collaboratively or even competitively. A distinct feature of SCSs is the diffuse nature of control activities and their complex influence on other activities. Activity control (ACON) extends the scope of traditional access control models and considers how multiple administrative authorities (including users) can manage complex and interacting usage, service and control activities. In this paper, we articulate key characteristics and limitations of various existing access control models and highlight the significance and necessity of activity control in smart collaborative ecosystems. We then propose an extended ACON framework for catering to the needs of dynamic SCSs. Furthermore, we compare existing access control design principles and propose a set of activity control design principles for smart and collaborative computing systems.

Based on the presented system, a robust energy-efficient resource allocation scheme is proposed to guarantee the outage probability requirements of controllers and actuators while realizing the maximization of the system energy efficiency. Different from the existing works, imperfect channel state information is studied for energy-efficient resource allocation in CPS3. To effectively handle the formulated optimization problem, the concept of virtual devices is introduced to equivalently reformulate the original problem. Afterward, the probabilistic mixed problem is approximately transformed into a nonprobabilistic problem though outage probability analyses. After the transformation, the optimization problem can be decomposed into power allocation and channel allocation, where an iterative algorithm for power allocation is adopted to maximize the system energy, and a heuristic greedy algorithm is presented to schedule sensors and actuators on different subchannels based on the obtained power allocation results. Simulation results demonstrate the convergency of the proposed algorithm and the advantages of the proposed scheme.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2869774","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771366); 111 Project of China(grant numbers:B08038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8462751","Cyber-physical-social smart system (CPS3);energy efficiency;imperfect channel state information (CSI);Internet of Things (IoT);virtualization","Resource management;Virtualization;Actuators;Sensors;Internet of Things;Robustness;Physical layer","","26","","35","IEEE","12 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

IoT has been growing rapidly in different domains, which led to the development of numerous IoT platforms, standards, and protocols, etc. Today, within a Smart City, different types of IoT systems and applications are deployed which operate independently. There is a need to enable city authorities and application developers to see IoT systems as part of an integrated whole, allowing optimal use of existing infrastructure and achieving more than what these independent systems can do in isolation. Furthermore, with the arrival of European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the governance of diverse IoT resources has become a critical requirement.

They are complex systems in which multiple constituent systems work together to achieve higher-level goals. These systems are called cyber-physical systems of systems (CPSoS). As the interest in CPSoS, such as platooning vehicles and robot-based smart factories, increases, engineering for adaptive goal achievement of CPSoS is needed. Common exemplars of a research community can facilitate research; however, existing exemplars of CPSoS are mostly based on virtual simulations. Although this allows researchers to share experimental scenarios and environments, it has the limitation that it is difficult to conduct experiments that reflect actual physical environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a physical exemplar of an industrial CPSoS, called Platooning LEGOs, which employs platooning technology that is actively being developed by the autonomous driving industry. A platoon, in which independent vehicles drive together, achieves SoS-level goals through adaptive behavioral decisions of the vehicles. This exemplar provides a physical experimental environment that can be implemented with LEGOs. A simple LEGO assembly allows the use of real data from sensors and actuators, facilitating a focus on software engineering without considerable mechanical knowledge. Moreover, as this is an open exemplar, researchers can implement the same physical experimental environment with a limited budget and expand its physical or software elements. We provide system descriptions, physical and software implementation manuals, and sample experimental results of Platooning LEGOs.","2157-2321","978-1-6654-0289-7","10.1109/SEAMS51251.2021.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462025","Platooning LEGOs;Self-adaptive system;Cyber-Physical System;System-of-Systems;Cyber-physical System-of-Systems;Lego;Exemplar;Experimental environment","Mechanical sensors;Knowledge engineering;Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Manuals;Software;Autonomous vehicles","","10","","20","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those devices communicate with computing infrastructure servers over network infrastructures to send relevant collected data in order to link physical objects to the cyber world. As the number of IoT devices increases rapidly, the volume of collected data likewise increases prodigiously. Thus, how to search for and through specific IoT datasets among the enormous amount of data become critical issues for potential data consumers. Moreover, various IoT devices and applications establish IoT-based systems, also known as the smart-world systems or smart cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as smart grids, smart transportation, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart homes, and smart manufacturing systems, among others. However, the individual CPS are independently designed and deployed, such that they collect and analyze data independently, with no information sharing or interconnection, raising serious challenges in searching for valuable information. Thus, in order to efficiently and precisely utilize the IoT datasets, suitable search techniques designed for the IoT environments are fundamental.

In this paper, we propose to leverage statistical learning methods to characterize the device behavior and flag deviations as anomalies. Because the system statistics, such as CPU usage cycles, disk usage, etc., can be obtained by IoT application program interfaces, the proposed framework is platform and deviceindependent. Considering IoT applications, we train multiple machine learning models to evaluate their feasibility and suitability. For the target auto-sustainable IoT devices, which operate well-planned processes, the normal system performances can be modeled accurately. Based on time series analysis methods, such as local outlier factor, cumulative sum, and the proposed adaptive online thresholding, the anomalous behaviors can be effectively detected. Comparing their performances on detecting anomalies as well as the computation sources required, we conclude that relatively simple machine learning models are more suitable for IoT security, and a data-driven anomaly detection method is preferred.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2897063","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8633365","Anomaly detection;deep learning;failure and intrusion detection;Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning","Internet of Things;Security;Anomaly detection;Predictive models;Time series analysis;Adaptation models;Computational modeling","","72","","41","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we investigate typical IoT network scenarios that can disrupt system performance. To ensure the adequacy of the models under study, we have analyzed the characteristics of real constrained IoT devices in terms of computing power and data rate. The simulation results demonstrate efficiency of the blockchain technology for constrained devices and make it possible to evaluate applicability limits of the chosen consensus algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3085405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445066","Blockchain;consensus algorithm;constrained devices;Internet of Things;practical Byzantine fault tolerance","Blockchain;Consensus algorithm;Peer-to-peer computing;Internet of Things;Authentication;Fault tolerant systems;Fault tolerance","","51","","52","CCBY","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The replicated data are randomly selected and transmitted to create two layers of uncertainties that reduce the ability of adversaries to launch successful cyberattacks, without affecting the performance of the system in a normal operation. The theoretical foundations of designing the IoT network and optimal allocation of replicas per signal are developed for linear-time-invariant systems, and fundamental limits of uncertainties introduced by the framework are calculated. The orchestration of the layers and applications integrated in the proposed framework is demonstrated in experimental implementation on a real-time water system over a WiFi network, adopting a data-centric architecture. The implementation results demonstrate that the proposed framework considerably limits the impact of false-data-injection attacks, while decreasing the ability of adversaries to learn details about the physical system operation.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3144937","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N000141812395); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686952","Cyber–physical systems;cybersecurity;data replication;Internet of Things (IoT);moving target defense (MTD)","Uncertainty;Resource management;Internet of Things;Data models;Reconnaissance;Indexes;Systems operation","","11","","40","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It follows that to design IoT devices, and to be confident about their reliability and safety in use, they must be considered in this context of complex coupling—which may be dynamic and ad hoc, and include accidental assembly of systems. This paper aims to facilitate this by describing different kinds of coupling that may occur in and between IoT systems, including some which often appear to be neglected. We also suggest different ways of looking at these coupled systems, including the notion of Social Machines. Finally, we suggest that behaviours evident in social media might give insight into phenomena in IoT systems, for example ‘fake data’ by analogy with ‘fake news’.","","978-1-83953-089-0","10.1049/cp.2019.0136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9038000","CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS;SOCIAL MACHINES;RISK;DATA SPOOFING","","","","","","","19 Mar 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In this emergent scenario, securi-ty is one crucial aspect that must be considered from the very beginning. In fact, the security of a System of Sys-tems is not automatically granted even if the security of each constituent system is guaranteed.

The management of SoS risk must be holistic and should not assume that if risks are managed at the system level then SoS risk will be managed implicitly. A model-based approach is outlined, utilizing a central Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to represent risks and contributing factors.

The CPS is vulnerable to major cybersecurity attacks. To overcome this, there's a need for new deep learning (DL) techniques that can investigate, detect, and respond to changes in such attacks. In this paper, we proposed a DL model for cyber security attack detection in the CPS based on long-short term memory (LSTM). Moreover, the model has been evaluated using real-world datasets from Industrial Control System (ICS) datasets of gas pipelines, which consist of seven attack types with 19 features.

If there is a fault in the SoS policy, SoS may fail to reach its goal, even if there is no fault in the CSs. Such a call for SoS policy testing leads to an essential question-how can testers evaluate the effectiveness of test cases?In this paper, we suggest a mutation analysis approach for SoS policy testing. Mutation analysis is a systematic way of evaluating test cases using artificial faults called mutants. As a general mutation framework for SoS policy testing, we present an overview of mutation analysis in SoS policy testing as well as the key aspects that must be defined in practice. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, we provide a case study using a traffic management SoS with the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulator.

This paper proposes such a model, where people in different positions are entitled to sign on behalf of organizations or departments therein and extend that to representing machines. Central in this model is the Power of Attorney (PoA), which is a self-contained and signed digital document that for a limited time and in a defined context, authorizes a particular agent (whether a person or device) to sign on behalf of a principal.

Simulation results show that our algorithm performs efficiently regarding computation complexity and energy efficiency in comparison with existing QoS-based algorithms.","","978-1-4673-9944-9","10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8355213","Internet of Things;Internet of Things service;Energy consumption;service composition;Quality of Service","Quality of service;Reliability;Task analysis;Security;Energy consumption;Internet of Things;Service-oriented architecture","","14","","16","IEEE","7 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Evaluating any IoT advancements comprehensively is critical to understand the conditions under which they can be more useful, as well as to assess the robustness and efficiency of IoT systems to validate them before their deployment in real life. Nevertheless, the creation of an appropriate IoT test environment is a difficult, effort-intensive, and expensive task; typically requiring a significant amount of human effort and physical hardware to build it. To tackle this problem, emulation tools to test IoT devices have been proposed. However, there is a lack of systematic approaches for evaluating IoT emulation environments.

This article presents a knowledge-driven architecture enabling dynamic device reconfiguration using the Web ontology language (OWL) and terse triple language (TTL) formats. Key components include a capability ontology, session-type information for sequencing and concurrent operations, and an integrated development environment (IDE) for automated control design. The capability ontology standardizes machine capabilities, facilitating device integration based on their capabilities, while session-type information ensures correct sequencing and synchronization of machine functions. The IDE platform supports dynamic reconfiguration by automating device selection, control strategy formulation, and system adjustments across diverse use cases. The architecture has been validated in real-world scenarios, including smart meeting rooms, warehouse automation, and energy management, showing a reduction in manual configuration time (up to 50%), development time (86% in some cases), and error rates (30%). Benchmarking results indicate faster code generation (40% improvement) and efficient component integration across different CPS environments. Challenges like computational complexity, scalability, and integration with existing systems highlight limitations. Future research will explore further optimizations and broader applicability to ensure low-latency, high-accuracy, and seamless integration in complex CPS.

In this approach, instead of providing products with after-sale services, the value proposition is mostly based on guaranteeing a trustable operation. As a result, capturing and analyzing information from a machine’s condition during its lifespan becomes an essential part of the smart PSS. Enabling this through lifecycle monitoring, sensing devices are at the core of smart PSS. Thus, the optimal configuration of PSS components is a critical step to ensure the efficiency of the solution. PSS design challenges arise because of the differences between characteristics and specifications of the embedded sensing system and the product. To fulfill this challenge, knowledge extraction and reuse from these domains is crucial during the design process. To do so, a sensor ontology is used as the backbone of the PSS knowledge-based framework. The focus of this paper is on defining the embedded sensing systems tailored to industrial PSS and the use of these systems in providing customized services. As part of the ICP4Life platform, this paper presents a sensing system ontology as a framework to support the smart services in industrial machinery PSS. An industrial use case is conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed ontology and to show the benefits of the ICP4Life platform to reduce time and cost of PSS development processes.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2831279","ICP4Life Project(grant numbers:636862); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8352684","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs);machine health monitoring (MHM);ontology-based framework;product-service system (PSS);smart sensing system","Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Ontologies;Collaboration;Internet of Things;Cyber-physical systems;Computer architecture","","51","","44","IEEE","30 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, the visualization of the network enables the identification of potential systems of systems that emerge from the larger network of systems. These systems of systems cluster together around the edge of the overall network and include a logistics, electronic warfare, and force protection system of system.

Rather than relying solely on gargantuan centralized cloud servers, edge computing utilizes nearby devices and micro data centers to enable real-time, location-aware services and this distributed approach brings quicker responses and leaner loads by leveraging local gadgets to handle localized computing chores. However fully activating edge computing's potential requires surmounting a few obstacles first. Efficiently coordinating myriad devices for data storage and number-crunching poses logistical challenges.

IoT devices are used to enhance monitoring and control of such systems. CPS normal operation might be altered by physical component faults, which can be exploited to generate abnormal behaviour. Data-driven fault detection can be used in CPS to take advantage of the large amount of data being generated by IoT devices. However, the data can be noisy, corrupted or redundant, which can lead to misclassification and/or degradation in the performance of the detectors. A proper selection of data in terms of features and instances can improve the quality of the data and enhance the performance of such detectors. Moreover, it can allow for the implementation of lightweight but still accurate fault detectors, which are required in resource constrained edge-based IoT environments. This work studies the unified problem of instance and feature selection, for the purpose of two-dimensional reduction, in class-based fault detection datasets used in IoT-based CPS. To avoid the high complexity required by an optimal two-dimensional reduction approach, we examine order-based feature and instance dataset reduction and evaluate the new fault detectors which are trained based on the reduced datasets, in terms of accuracy gain/loss. A new weighted metric which combines accuracy and dataset reduction rates is introduced that enables the selection of an appropriate reduction scheme per application. Experimental results suggest that a proper selection of instance and feature selection algorithms can significantly reduce dataset size by up to 90%.","","978-1-6654-8356-8","10.1109/COINS54846.2022.9854937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854937","Instance Selection;Feature Selection;Dataset Reduction;Fault Detection;Machine Learning;Cyber Physical Systems (CPS);Internet of Things (IoT)","Performance evaluation;Degradation;Fault detection;Image edge detection;Detectors;Feature extraction;Internet of Things","","","","19","IEEE","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enterprise IoT (E-IoT) connect such environments to the Internet and are professionally managed solutions usually offered by dedicated vendors As E-IoT systems require specialized training, closed-source software, and proprietary equipment to deploy. In effect, E-IoT systems present an unprecedented, under-researched, and unexplored threat vector for an attacker. In this work, we focus on E-IoT drivers, software modules used to integrate devices into E-IoT systems, as an attack mechanism. We first present PoisonIvy, a series of generalized proof-of-concept attacks used to demonstrate that an attacker can use a malicious driver to perform denial-of-service attacks, gain remote control, and abuse E-IoT system resources. To defend against E-IoT driver-based threats, we introduce Ivycide, a novel intrusion detection system used to detect unexpected E-IoT network traffic from an E-IoT system. Ivycide operates as a passive monitoring system within an E-IoT system using machine learning and signature-based classification to detect Poisonivy attacks. We evaluated the performance of Ivycide in a realistic E-IoT deployment.

In this, authorization is a key component for regulating the detailed access credentials with respect to required service resources. Authorization, therefore, plays a significant role in the trust management of autonomous devices and services. Due to the heterogeneous nature of cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things, several authorization techniques using different access control models, accounts, groups, tokens, and delegations have both strengths and weaknesses. Many studies exist in the literature that focus on other main security requirements, such as authentication, identity management, and confidentiality. However, there is a need for a comprehensive review of different authorization techniques in cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. A specific target of this paper is authorization in the cyber-physical system and Internet of Things networks with non-constrained devices in an industrial context with mobility, subcontractors, and autonomous machines that are able to carry out advanced tasks on behalf of others. We study the different authorization techniques using our three-dimensional classification, including access control models, subgranting models, and authorization governance. We focus on the state of the art of authorization subgranting, including delegation techniques by access control/authorization server and self-contained authorization using a new concept of power of attorney. Comparisons are performed with respect to several parameters, such as type of communication, method of authorization, control of expiration, and use of techniques such as public key certificate, encryption techniques, and tokens. The results show the differences and similarities of server-based and power of attorney-based authorization subgranting.

The proposed solution uses this methodology to strengthen reliability, fault tolerance and security at system level but also to support CPS designs that work in a decentralized way, collaboratively, in an equilibrium, by sharing tasks and data with minimal central intervention. Also, the proposed system supports the interaction of the CPSoS with their human users/operators through extended reality modules (AR glasses, haptics interfaces) to increase human situational awareness but also to include human behavior in the CPSoS design and operation phase.

In this article, we propose an online distributed IoT security monitoring algorithm (ODIS). An advanced influential point selection operation extracts important information from multidimensional time-series data across distributed sensor nodes based on the spatial and temporal data dependence structure. Then, an accurate data structure model is constructed to capture the IoT system behaviors. Next, hypothesis testing is carried out to quantify the uncertainty of the monitoring tasks. Besides, the distributed system architecture solves the scalability issue. Using a real sensor network testbed, we commit cyberattacks to an IoT system with different patterns and strengths.

Cyber-physical systems are reaching a hitherto unseen level of complexity. To date, no unifying theory nor systematic design methods, techniques and tools exist for such systems. Individual (mechanical, electrical, network or software) engineering disciplines only offer partial solutions. Multi-paradigm Modelling (MPM) proposes to model every part and aspect of such complex systems explicitly, at the most appropriate level(s) of abstraction, using the most appropriate modelling formalism(s). This includes the explicit modelling of the often complex engineering workflows. Modelling language engineering, including model transformation, and the study of their semantics, are used to realize MPM. MPM is seen as an effective answer to the challenges of designing CPS. This presentation introduces some of the challenges of collaborative development of CPS as well as possible multi-paradigm modelling solutions such as (in-)consistency management and co-simulation.","","978-1-4503-5728-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445070","Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM);Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)","Cyber-physical systems;Computational modeling;Conferences;Software engineering;Biological system modeling;Computer science;Hydraulic systems","","1","","","","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, reliability and resiliency are key concerns in CPS in the face of unforeseen circumstances, often emanating from disaster based failures. In this paper, critical issues of centralized database security in CPS are addressed via a distributed blockchain based solution. The proposed system encompasses a smart contract based framework in Ethereum blockchain. It further explores the potential of blockchain in securing and offering a distributed network for the CPS in a closed loop manner. To demonstrate the realizability of the proposed framework, a testbed implementation for the proposed idea is provided. A desktop computer, a laptop, a simple temperature sensor and a Light Emitting Diode (LED) are interfaced in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network using Ethereum.

In many cases, complex CPSs have several goals to satisfy simultaneously. To develop a CPS with multiple goals, engineers can create various control systems, each contributing to a goal based on a system-of-systems (SoS) engineering perspective. Engineers then conduct field operational tests (FOTs) to collect data for analyzing and optimizing the control systems. However, uncertainties in the physical environment and the emergent behavior of multiple controllers present several challenges in conducting FOTs. We have hands-on experience in performing massive FOTs of a multi-controller CPS to realize engineering challenges in the FOTs. We modeled and developed an autonomous robot vehicle consisting of a lane-keeping system and an adaptive cruise control system. To analyze and optimize autonomous driving, we conducted FOTs of 125 possible configurations of the control systems, each 50 times. This paper presents 1) the model, software, and hardware implementation manuals of our case study on autonomous driving, 2) an FOT log dataset obtained from about 100 hours of driving and its analysis results, 3) research challenges emerging in the multi-controller CPS FOT learned from our hands-on experience, and 4) possible applications of our dataset for future research.","","978-1-6654-9623-0","10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812701","Cyber-physical systems;Multi-controller;System-of-systems;Autonomous vehicle;Field operational test dataset","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Uncertainty;Manuals;Cyber-physical systems;Software;Hardware","","1","","44","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The lightweight and low-power physical layer security (PLS) technology is employed to protect the information from eavesdropping. Taking the imperfect channel state information (CSI) into account, we formulate a problem to optimize the beamforming vector, artificial noise (AN), transmit power, and subcarrier assignment policy aiming to maximize the worst case sum secrecy rate under the Quality of Service (QoS) and power consumption constraints. Since the formulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to be solved, we decompose it into two joint optimization subproblems. The first is resource allocation with given subcarrier assignment, which is solved by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach. The second is subcarrier assignment solved by the matching theory. Our simulation shows that the proposed scheme is robust against the CSI imperfectness of the eavesdropping and self-interference channels, while providing significant sum secrecy rate improvement compared with the orthogonal multiple access (OMA), half duplex (HD) systems, and other benchmark schemes.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3110974","Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China, entitled “Research on the Key-technologies Application of 5G Communication based on Typical Scenarios of Power Distribution Internet of Things,”(grant numbers:5700-201999539A-0-0-00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530720","Full duplex (FD);Internet of Things (IoT);multicarrier nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA);physical layer security (PLS);robust resource allocation","Resource management;NOMA;Internet of Things;Uplink;Downlink;Array signal processing;Quality of service","","18","","49","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the coupling of safety-critical embedded systems and services of the cyber-space domain introduce many new challenges for system engineers. Especially, the goal to achieve a high level of security throughout CPS presents a major challenge. However, it is necessary to develop and deploy secure CPS, as vulnerabilities and threats may lead to a non- or maliciously modified functionality of the CPS. This could ultimately cause harm to life of involved actors, or at least sensitive information can be leaked or lost. Therefore, it is essential that system engineers are aware of the level of security of the deployed CPS. For this purpose, security metrics and security evaluation frameworks can be utilized, as they are able to quantitatively express security, based on different measurements and rules. However, existing security scoring solutions may not be able to generate accurate security scores for CPS, as they insufficiently consider the typical CPS characteristics, like the communication of heterogeneous systems of physical- and cyber-space domain in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, we propose a security analysis framework, called Security Qualification Matrix (SQM). The SQM is capable to analyses multiple attacks on a System-of-Systems level simultaneously. With this approach, dependencies, potential side effects and the impact of mitigation concepts can quickly be identified and evaluated.","","978-1-7281-9664-0","10.1109/ICM50269.2020.9331797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331797","Security Qualification Matrix;Security Metric;Threat Analysis;Security Scoring;Cyber-Physical Systems","Cyberspace;Cyber-physical systems;Smart grids;Microelectronics;Security;Qualifications;Smart manufacturing","","4","","16","IEEE","28 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on this calculation, it is assumed that the vehicles will arrive on time at the traffic light when it has changed from its red phase to the green phase.","2154-0373","978-1-4799-8802-0","10.1109/EIT.2015.7293395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293395","Cyber-Physical Systems;Smart System;Traffic Light Control System;Internet of Things;Sensor Networks","Roads;Cyber-physical systems;Automobiles;Intelligent sensors;Peer-to-peer computing","","12","","9","IEEE","8 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Real large-scale interoperability requires layers of standards, and each layer addresses different interoperability challenges. The SensorThings API data model seeks to tackle data interoperability at the data and informational layers of IoT platforms. SensorThings API is aligned to the ISO/OGC O&M data standard, and like O&M it is semi-structured. Semi-structured models allow for variance within implementations for different use-cases, which is both necessary and detrimental to systems interoperability.In this paper we propose that the SensorThings API data model should be defined as a set of archetypes, used to capture extensible domain concepts using a two-level modeling IoT systems design approach.

Internet of things (IoT), advanced computing architectures and digital platforms are among the new technologies that are enhancing the data collection and analytics perceptions in the era of Industry 4.0. Fault tree modelling and failure analysis of systems have been traditionally performed using exhaustively expert knowledge. However, nowadays cyber-physical systems are equipped with sensors and meters, enabling reliability analysis to become more automated and less human-dependent. There have been approaches that fully depend on data that utilized these new developments. However, completely ignoring human cognitive capabilities and expert knowledge causes a great loss of information, which might only be compensated by collecting large amounts of data that is costly in many aspects, and sometimes even impossible. In this paper we discuss how and to what extend expert knowledge can be fused or combined with data to learn fault trees of cyber-physical systems. We, furthermore, point out the gap in availability of systematic methods for fusing data with expert knowledge for the purpose of reliability analysis of cyber-physical systems.

The mobile IoT systems generate an enormous volume of a variety of dynamic context data and typically count on centralized architectures to process them. However, their inability to ensure security and decline in communication efficiency and response time with the increase in the size of IoT network are some of the many concerning weaknesses that are holding back the fast-paced growth of IoT. Realizing the limitations of centralized systems, recently blockchain-based decentralized architecture is being considered as the key to redesigning the IoT systems in a way that is designed to be secure, transparent, highly resistant to outages, auditable, and efficient. However, before realizing the new promise of blockchain for IoT, there are significant challenges to address. One fundamental challenge is the scale issue around data collection, storage, and analytic as IoT sensor devices possess limited computational power and storage capabilities. In particular, since the chain is always growing, IoT devices require more and more resources. Thus, an oversized chain poses storage and scalability problems. With this in mind, the overall goal of our research is to design a lightweight scalable blockchain framework for IoT of mobile devices. This framework, coined as ""Sensor-Chain"", promises a new generation of lightweight blockchain management with a superior reduction in resource consumption, and at the same time capable of retaining critical information about the IoT systems of mobile devices.","","978-1-7281-2980-8","10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8875416","IoT;Blockchain;Storage;Mobility","Blockchain;Internet of Things;Peer-to-peer computing;Computer architecture;Security;Edge computing;Smart homes","","32","","33","IEEE","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A number of studies have distinguished these different types of SoS and proposed various classifications. In general, though, each study proposes a classification from a particular, fixed perspective, which as such leads to a limited view of the SoS. This paper proposes a novel multi-dimensional classification approach that builds on and enhances the reported existing classifications. In contrast to previous studies, a multidimensional classification of SoS is presented that has been derived after a thorough domain analysis process.

The encryption of these images is essential for maintaining operational integrity, data confidentiality, and seamless integration with analytics platforms. This paper addresses these critical concerns by proposing a robust image encryption algorithm tailored for IIoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The algorithm combines Rule-30 cellular automata with chaotic scrambling and substitution. The Rule 30 cellular automata serves as an efficient mechanism for generating pseudo-random sequences that enable fast encryption and decryption cycles suitable for realtime sensor data in industrial settings. Most importantly, it induces non-linearity in the encryption algorithm. Furthermore, to increase the chaotic range and keyspace of the algorithm, which is vital for security in distributed industrial networks, a hybrid chaotic map, i.e., logistic-sine map is utilized. Extensive security analysis has been carried out to validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Results indicate that our algorithm achieves close-to-ideal values, with an entropy of 7.99 and a correlation of 0.002.

Enhanced Secure Channel Authentication utilising random forests and software-defined networking (SCAFFOLD) is a proposed adaptive security framework in this article that is designed specifically for Internet of Things (IoT) settings. The architecture uses machine learning and software-defined networking (SDN) to set up safe routes of communication between Internet of Things (IoT) nodes. Contemporary constraint-based CPS programs suffer from security and privacy issues, which the proposed method aims to address. A possible result is a simple method for verifying the identity of cyber-physical things. A new kind of security algorithm ensures that cyber-physical systems can adapt and operate autonomously without compromising user data or device security. Developed on the Raspberry platform, a new middleware module allows CPS-based devices and services to communicate more easily, which increases both flexibility and scalability. Effortless, user-centric, The two CPS units can verify each other's identities using the proposed approach. The bigger a network gets, the more vulnerable it is to attacks. Attacks on the Internet of Things network are thus much more likely to succeed than on traditional networks. The proliferation of interconnected devices has coincided with an expansion in the variety of security vulnerabilities. Modern technology is crucial for defending the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem against the dangers that exist today. A minimal computational overhead and high efficiency level are prerequisites for the suggested method. It safeguards wireless transmissions by generating random session keys. Many different types of cyber threats cannot reach the system. Modern constraint-based CPS systems necessitate a fresh, minimal security paradigm.","","979-8-3315-0843-2","10.1109/ICEC59683.2024.10837268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10837268","Internet of Things;IoT security;software-defined networking;machine learning;attack detection","Adaptation models;Electric potential;Data analysis;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Ecosystems;Data models;Internet of Things;Security;Software defined networking","","","","15","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed design approach identifies the optimal instantiation of the system architecture and deployment of the applications to minimize the monetary cost of the solution while guaranteeing resource requirements and fault tolerance.

The edge devices in a CPS are able to calculate a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) from local observation for one or more events via a consensus approach to iteratively optimize the consensus LLRs for the whole CPS system. The information-exchange topologies are considered as a collection of jointly connected networks and an iterative distributed consensus algorithm is proposed to optimize the LLRs to form a global optimal decision. Each active device in the CPS first detects the local region and obtains a local LLR, which then exchanges with its active neighbors. Compressed data collection is enforced by a reliable cluster partitioning scheme, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network lifetime. Then the LLR estimations are improved iteratively until a global optimum is reached. The proposed distributed consensus algorithm can converge fast and hence improve the reliability with lower transmission burden and computation costs in CPS. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2906157","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571360); Shaanxi Science and Technology Co-ordination and Innovation Project(grant numbers:2016KTZDGY05-09); Innovation Project of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education(grant numbers:17JF023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669811","Consensus algorithm;cyber-physical systems (CPSs);data gathering;Internet of Things (IoT);security events detection","Event detection;Topology;Consensus algorithm;Reliability;Network topology;Internet of Things;Sensors","","59","","37","IEEE","19 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So to provide security and privacy to this information in IoT is a very challenging task, which is to be concerned at highest priority for several current and future applications. Devices such as smart phone, WSNs and RFIDs etc., are the major components of IoT network which are basically resource constrained devices. Design and development of security and privacy management schemes for these devices are guided by factors like good performance, low power consumption, robustness to attacks, tampering of the data and end to end security. Security schemes in IoT provide unauthorized access to information or other objects by protecting against alterations or destruction. In this paper, we propose hybrid confidentiality algorithm which is a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Message-Digest algorithm (MD5) algorithms. Geo encryption or location based encryption is also integrated with hybrid algorithm to give confidentiality to every devices.

Systems of systems differ from traditional systems in ways that require tailoring of systems engineering processes to successfully deliver their capabilities.[1] This paper describes the distinct characteristics of systems of systems that impact their reliability, discusses their unique challenges, and recommends strategies for managing them. DoD has shifted from a system perspective to a capability perspective where the value to users is the collective effect of a set of systems rather than any one system.[1-2] The SOS approach to meeting requirements remains a challenge when defense systems continue to demonstrate poor reliability during operationol testing (OT). Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) reported in 2015 to Congress that only “38 percent of systems that had an Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) or Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) met their reliability requirements.” [5] This leads to questions about how to better define capabilities, impacts to design and how to integrate and test at the SoS level to achieve reliable systems. [1-5] This paper looks at SoS and reliability from the perspective of systems engineering and addresses the questions: What are the critical characteristics of SoS that affect T&E and reliability? What are the reliability implications for SoS? This paper reviews the characteristics of SoS as they impact reliability, and how aspects of reliability are addressed by the practice of SoS SE. Finally, it discusses the implications for Reliability of SoS, including specific challenges and the strategies currently employed to address them.","","978-1-5090-5284-4","10.1109/RAM.2017.7889676","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889676","System of Systems;System Engineering;Reliability and Maintainability Engineering","Stakeholders;Reliability engineering;System of systems;Standards;Collaboration","","3","","15","IEEE","30 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper lays forth a thorough plan to improve cyber-physical security by bolstering intrusion detection systems (IDS) with the use of digital twin technology (DTT). Virtual representations of physical systems, or ""digital twins,"" allow for sophisticated modelling, predictive analytics, and real-time monitoring. Incorporating DTT with IDS allows for proactive and dynamic threat detection and response in this system. Datasets generated by an ICS testbed— a device designed to monitor storage reservoir water levels and turbulence—form the basis of the suggested architecture. The SCADA system uses a number of indicators to assess the efficacy of several machine learning (ML) models that are used to detect and categorize intrusions. The findings show that ML approaches are great at detecting intrusions, with low false positive rates and high detection rates. Also, the IDS can now identify more complex and unique assaults because to DTT's incorporation, which enables continuous system learning and adaptability. An important step forward in cyber-physical security, this research shows that digital twins have the ability to change intrusion detection systems (IDS) from reactive to proactive. The framework offers a durable and scalable approach to safeguard vital infrastructures from ever-changing cyber threats, and its ramifications reach into a wide range of industrial applications. The integration of Digital Twin Technology (DTT) with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for cyber-physical security showed significant improvements in threat detection. Test results revealed a 40% increase in early intrusion detection accuracy compared to traditional IDS models.

However, traditional massive MIMO suffers from high power consumption and fabrication cost. The design of energy-efficient massive MIMO technology is essential for larger scale industrial deployments. In this article, we design three types of nonlinear RF chain structures, which not only reduce the power consumption of massive MIMO systems but also save fabrication costs. Information theoretic analysis demonstrates the power efficiency performance of our nonlinear system design. Our nonlinear MIMO system designs can increase the power efficiency by up to 2.3 times compared with the traditional MIMO system. We have demonstrated that our systems can achieve the same uplink rate as traditional MIMO by increasing the number of receiving antennas but with less overall power consumption. We also proposed an algorithm to overcome the problem of low computational efficiency due to high-dimensional integration when calculating the uplink achievable rate of nonlinear MIMO. Moreover, we reveal that when the skew-normal distribution is used as signaling, the nonlinear MIMO systems can achieve better performance than the Gaussian distribution.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3024631","CERNET Innovation Project(grant numbers:NGIICS20190301); Construction of System-level Connected Vehicle Test and Verification Platform(grant numbers:2019-00892-2-1); University of Technology Sydney; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200720","Cyber–physical systems;information theory;Internet of Things (IoT);low power consumption;nonlinear mimo systems;uplink achievable rate","Radio frequency;MIMO communication;Power demand;Detectors;Analog-digital conversion;Informatics;Antennas","","72","","31","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Looking for parking space waste a lot of time as a user has to search for parking space, since lack of car parking information. It results in traffic congestion, environmental pollution making the environment more badly. A lot of approaches have been developed to solve this problem but they are insufficient either they are not sufficient to cope with the user needs and they are not able to communicate properly with the external interfaces or they are much costly. The proposed solution based on CPS, solve the problem of car parking system. The proposed solution is effective and efficient as the user will enter location details using the smartphone app and send it to the server. The server will search for the available parking slots, getting information from sensors and send it back to the user with the route directions. The user will follow that particular route and park vehicle at the area designated by the server.

To address this gap, we propose the Holon Programming Model (HPM), a software-defined framework that facilitates the flexible development and orchestration of these behaviours. By decoupling programming concerns from SoS composition, HPM enhances the programmability and adaptability of SoS in dynamic settings.

The availability of accurate models is essential to investigate the impact of traffic patterns created by the introduction of new services such as those forecasted for the Internet of Things (IoT). The Poisson model has historically been a popular aggregated traffic model and has been extensively used by the IoT research community. However, the Poisson model implicitly assumes an infinite number of traffic sources, which may not be a valid assumption in various plausible application scenarios. The practical conditions under which the Poisson model is valid in the context of IoT have not been fully investigated, in particular under a finite (and possibly reduced) number of traffic sources with random inter-arrival times. In this context, this letter derives exact mathematical models for the packet inter-arrival times of aggregated IoT data traffic based on the superposition of a finite number of traffic sources, each of which is modelled based on real-world experimental data from typical IoT sensors (temperature, light and motion). The obtained exact models are used to explore the validity of the Poisson model, showing that it can be extremely inaccurate when a reduced number of traffic sources is considered.

A large number of IoT devices are application-specific which makes the network difficult to manage and change. The Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm brings a new perspective of solving the network rigidity issue. By introducing the OpenFlow protocol to the IoT network, the routing decisions can be translated into matching rules and actions in a programmable way, thus simplifying the network configuration and management. However, different from the wired domain, which uses a separate dedicated network for OpenFlow channel, the IoT devices have to communicate with the Controller in a multi-hop way. Since some IoT nodes are unstable due to the limited energy, environment or other factors, the multi-hop way results in an unstable control channel, which degrades the network performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a practical SDN-based network architecture for Internet of things. We propose an Optimal Control Channel (OCC) policy to select minimum number of nodes to establish a stable OpenFlow channel to reduce the performance loss caused by unstable IoT nodes. OCC establishes a stable control channel to bridge the IoT nodes and the Controller. Meanwhile, OCC is responsible for the control messages aggregation to further decrease the SDN-inherent control overheads. The experimental results show our architecture outperforms the original SDN-based scheme in terms of control overheads.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622900","Internet of Things;SDN;Control Overhead;Optimal Control Channel","Internet of Things;Optimal control;Spread spectrum communication;Computer science;Routing;Performance evaluation;Bridges","","1","","16","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigate the freshness of the received updates and propose a new metric termed as age upon decisions (AuD), which is defined as the time elapsed from the generation of each update to the epoch it is used to make decisions (e.g., estimations, inferences, and controls). Within this framework, we aim at improving the freshness of updates at decision epochs by scheduling the update arrival process and the decision-making process. The theoretical results show that: 1) when the decisions are made according to a Poisson process, the average AuD is independent of decision rate and will be minimized if the arrival process is periodic (i.e., deterministic); 2) when both the decision process and the arrival process are periodic, the average AuD is larger, but decreases with decision rate to, the average AuD of the corresponding system with the Poisson decisions (i.e., random); and 3) when both the decision process and the arrival process are periodic, the average AuD can be further decreased by optimally controlling the offset between the two processes. For practical IoT systems, therefore, it is suggested to employ periodic arrival processes and random decision processes. Nevertheless, making the periodical updates and decisions with properly controlled offset is also a promising solution, if the timing information of the two processes can be accessed by the monitor.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2950054","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701247); Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Research Project(grant numbers:17KJB510035); Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology(grant numbers:2243141701008); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901066,61971077); Chongqing Science and Technology Commission(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyj-msxmX0575); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61621091); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2012CB316100(2)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8887253","Age of information (AoI);age upon decisions (AuD);decision scheduling;Internet of Things (IoT);update-and-decide systems","Monitoring;Process control;Internet of Things;Delays;Loss measurement;Decision making;Heart","","35","","28","IEEE","30 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Industry 4.0 includes the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing paradigms for developing smart systems, smart homes, and smart cities. Given Industry 4.0 is comprised sensor fields, actuators, fog and cloud processing paradigms, and network systems, designing a secure architecture faces two major challenges: handling heterogeneous sources at scale and maintaining security over a large, disparate, data-driven system that interacts with the physical environment. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new threat intelligence scheme that models the dynamic interactions of industry 4.0 components including physical and network systems. The scheme consists of two components: a smart management module and a threat intelligence module. The smart data management module handles heterogeneous data sources, one of the foundational requirements for interacting with an Industry 4.0 system. This includes data to and from sensors, actuators, in addition to other forms of network traffic. The proposed threat intelligence technique is designed based on beta mixture-hidden Markov models (MHMMs) for discovering anomalous activities against both physical and network systems. The scheme is evaluated on two well-known datasets: the CPS dataset of sensors and actuators and the UNSW-NB15 dataset of network traffic. The results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms five peer mechanisms, suggesting its effectiveness as a viable deployment methodology in real-Industry 4.0 systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844794","UNSW at ADFA Project OP001(grant numbers:1Z6300PS4,Z6300PS45623); Australian Department of Defence(grant numbers:DST-CERA 135); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8374422","Industry 4.0;threat intelligence;cyber-attacks;cyber-physical systems (CPS);Internet of Things (IoT);cloud;fog;beta mixture-hidden Markov models (MHMM)","Industries;Manufacturing;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Actuators;Security;Cyber-physical systems","","108","","55","OAPA","7 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The consequences of these attacks include compromising user privacy and intruding into devices, leading to physical damage or disruption of services. Smart cameras are such devices as a part of the broader Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem and are susceptible to various cyber-physical security threats. To mitigate these cyber-physical threats, manufacturers and users implement security best practices, including regular software updates, strong authentication mechanisms, encryption, and physical security measures. However, traditional methods are insufficient to detect anomalies in the face of evolving cyber-physical threats in real-time as they often rely on predefined rules. Machine learning (ML) based approaches learn from the data and adapt to changing attack patterns, enhancing the security of smart cameras against cyber-physical attacks. In this work, an ML-based adaptive security framework is proposed for smart cameras to dynamically adjust security measures in real-time processing for quick threat detection and immediate responses in case of security breaches or anomalies. A novel model, termed IALSTM (Inference Aware LSTM), is proposed to effectively implement edge-based smart security measures on resource-constrained edge computing devices.

One approach that is gaining momentum is the Web of Things, that uses web architecture and web standards as a framework for creating IoT applications. Two main protocols are used in the application layer of the Web of Things: HTTP and CoAP. This work presents the conception, design, and evaluation of an Interception Proxy for HTTP and CoAP interoperability. The proposed proxy preserves the organic nature of the Swarm, by allowing a transparent discovery and communication among devices. In this proposal, the proxy constitutes an independent entity that intercepts Swarm communications, and performs the mapping between HTTP and CoAP or vice versa, thus, extending the interaction capabilities of the network. The implementation is based on an existing library and the validation results show the correct functionality of the proxy and its ability of operating in Swarm scenarios.","","978-1-5090-5873-0","10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8016220","Proxy;Internet of Things;CoAP;HTTP","Protocols;Servers;Performance evaluation;Network topology;Topology;Internet of Things;Interoperability","","17","","22","IEEE","24 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Edge computing offers solution for latency aware computations at edge of the network but with limited resources available at edge nodes. This problem can be resolved by leveraging edge resources in a group and executing resource intensive task. Most previous studies deploy centralized methods for clustering but comes with overhead of cluster formation and management. In this article, key idea is to group heterogeneous edge nodes on task arrival in a decentralize way, and handle task allocation and execution in parallel on group devices to achieve its deadline. Our methodology will help to reduce traffic amount travelling towards cloud in case of resource intensive big tasks of SCPS applications. We have proposed an algorithm for decentralized group formation and presented task division and allocation methodology for parallel execution.

This PhD thesis targets robustness in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Devices are resource-constrained and connected via lossy links; therefore, fault prevention and rapid repair mechanisms are crucial. Meanwhile, monitoring should minimize the resulting energy and traffic overhead; to leave the network unconstrained during its normal operation. To tackle this problem, several integrated optimization models and efficient algorithms were proposed during the course of PhD. Our activities and results cover the monitor placement and scheduling problems. The topology is represented by a graph, and several graph related optimization problems can be solved. We aim at realizing a polynomial-time solvable monitor placement algorithm. Furthermore, to minimize the monitoring overhead and maximize longevity, monitoring roles should be balanced and alternated amongst nodes; therefore, we target optimal monitor scheduling. We propose a Binary Integer Programming problem formulation. We present the exact solution as well as an efficient heuristic. Extensive experimentation was conducted using different network sizes and topologies. Results confirm effective monitoring with minimum energy consumption and network overhead while balancing the monitoring role between nodes.","","978-1-5386-4980-0","10.1109/WF-IoT.2019.8767203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8767203","","Monitoring;Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Network topology;Analytical models;Real-time systems;Routing protocols","","8","","9","IEEE","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an emerging technology, I-IoT has distinct properties and requirements that distinguish it from consumer IoT, including the unique types of smart devices incorporated, network technologies and quality-of-service requirements, and strict needs of command and control. To more clearly understand the complexities of I-IoT and its distinct needs and to present a unified assessment of the technology from a systems’ perspective, in this paper, we comprehensively survey the body of existing research on I-IoT. Particularly, we first present the I-IoT architecture, I-IoT applications (i.e., factory automation and process automation), and their characteristics. We then consider existing research efforts from the three key system aspects of control, networking, and computing. Regarding control, we first categorize industrial control systems and then present recent and relevant research efforts. Next, considering networking, we propose a three-dimensional framework to explore the existing research space and investigate the adoption of some representative networking technologies, including 5G, machine-to-machine communication, and software-defined networking. Similarly, concerning computing, we again propose a second three-dimensional framework that explores the problem space of computing in I-IoT and investigate the cloud, edge, and hybrid cloud and edge computing platforms.

Such monitoring can help identify possible future failures and develop a cost-effective maintenance plan. However, it is a daunting task to perform early detection with low false positives and negatives from the huge volume of collected data. This requires developing a holistic machine learning framework to address the issues in condition monitoring of high priority components and develop efficient techniques to detect anomalies that can detect and possibly localize the faulty components. This paper presents a comparative analysis of recent machine learning approaches for robust, cost-effective anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems. While detection has been extensively studied, very few researchers have analyzed the localization of the anomalies. We show that supervised learning outperforms unsupervised algorithms. For supervised cases, we achieve near-perfect accuracy of 98% (specifically for tree-based algorithms). In contrast, the best-case accuracy in the unsupervised cases was 63%—the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) exhibits similar outcomes as an additional metric.","","978-1-6654-9623-0","10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812638","Machine learning;condition monitoring;anomaly detection;cyber-physical systems","Condition monitoring;Machine learning algorithms;Supervised learning;Machine learning;Receivers;Cyber-physical systems;Task analysis","","4","","15","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchain can allow this information to be stored in a manner that is both accessible and reliable for the IoT devices to work with. Blockchain has the capability to collect data from IoT devices and store it in a distributed manner that prevents tampering with the data. This paper discusses the use of blockchain to calculate the Service Quality (SQ) in an Industrial IoT for monitoring application. The proposed framework looks at the blockchain as a finite number of fragmented pieces of data corresponding to a specific industrial process. The SQ is expressed as penalties which is the difference between the expected IoT sensor values and the actual sensor data in reported events from the IoT devices. It also moderates the penalty between similar industrial processes based on each other. The moderation allows better understanding of the system functions and identification of specific problems rather than simply recording the sensor data for a single process. Furthermore, this paper analyzes private blockchains for suitability in IIoT and summarizes some key challenges for IoT to be used with blockchain in context of the proposed framework. The paper uses supply chain as a use case scenario for describing the proposed framework and presents results on its technical feasibility.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8876654","Blockchain;internet of things;cyber-physical systems;logistics;p2p network;smart contract","Blockchain;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Supply chains;Industries;Security","","23","","52","CCBY","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

IoT devices are resource constrained devices and hence it is very easy to exhaust them of their resources or deny availability. One of the most prominent attacks on the availability is the Distributed Denial of service (DDoS) attack. Although, DDoS is not a new Internet attack but a large number of new, constrained and globally accessible IoT devices have escalated the attack surface beyond imagination. This paper provides a broad anatomy of IoT protocols and their inherent weaknesses that can enable attackers to launch successful DDoS attacks. One of the major contributions of this paper is the implementation and demonstration of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) flood attack in the Contiki operating system, an open-source operating system for the IoT. This attack has been implemented and demonstrated in Cooja simulator, an inherent feature of the Contiki operating system. Furthermore, in this paper, a rate limiting mechanism is proposed that must be incorporated in the Contiki OS to mitigate UDP flood attacks. This proposed scheme reduces CPU power consumption of the victim by 9% and saves the total transmission power of the victim by 55%.","","978-1-5090-6471-7","10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8229997","UDP flood;ICMP;Internet of things;Contiki;Cooja Simulator","Computer crime;Protocols;Floods;Limiting;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Internet of Things","","8","","12","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We design the architecture of smart NCAP from perspectives of embedding SNMP module, management work and mechanism for interacting with nodes.

Almost every pharmaceutical company has a water purifying unit as a part of its interdependent systems. Early detection of faults right at the edge can significantly decrease maintenance costs and improve safety and output quality, and as a result, lead to the production of better medicines. In this article, with the help of a few sensors and data mining approaches, an anomaly detection system is built for CHRIST Osmotron water purifier. This is a practical research with real-world data collected from SinaDarou Labs Co. Data collection was done by using six sensors over two-week intervals before and after system overhaul. This gave us normal and faulty operation samples. Given the data, we propose two anomaly detection approaches to build up our edge fault detection system. The first approach is based on supervised learning and data mining, e.g., by support vector machines. However, since we cannot collect all possible faults data, an anomaly detection approach is proposed based on normal system identification which models the system components by artificial neural networks.

Based on the fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithm that is applied to cyber-physical component systems (CPCS), located at the bottom level, a bottom-up monitoring is enabled detecting faulty behaviors and informing the supervisor at a higher level of the fault information. Meanwhile, upon the received fault information, the supervisor is able sending instructions to component systems at lower levels to optimize the performance of the whole SoS, which is named as top-down reconfiguration. Compared with previous works mainly performing the reconfiguration from only one aspect, this work develops a comprehensive reconfiguration framework from communication, operational independence and mission perspectives based on hypergraph drawn from related viewpoints.

IoT is a cyber-physical system which essentially includes smart sensors, actuators, and gateways that are networked to communicate a stream of data to the data analytic platform. The advances in communication technology, computational technologies and data analytics allow effective monitoring and predictive control of the physical system. IoT is being applied in various domains ranging from factories, transportation, power grids and buildings with a common aim to make them smart and enhance value to their stakeholders. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) was the most preferred domain in an electric grid substation where we could see the IoT concepts being implemented some four to five decades back. With the advent of newer Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), there is an urge for more effective monitoring and predictive controls of the assets in a transmission system which in turn will enhance the reliability, availability and overall efficiency of the system. IoT technology can be applied in transmission and distribution sectors to improve reliability and availability at a reduced cost which might be beneficial to the utilities as well as end customers. This paper reviews the IoT readiness of EHV substations in transmission systems and also the gaps which need to be filled whilst its implementation. Major components considered in a typical transmission system are High Voltage Primary Equipment, Station Auxiliaries, Transmission Lines and Control Buildings wherein the smart sensors are embedded in form of meters, transducers, potential free dry contacts, communication ports on legacy protocols and other communicable IoT devices. These transmission assets can be protected and monitored concerning their operating parameters and their health to decide upon the asset management strategy.","","978-1-6654-6855-8","10.1109/GCAT55367.2022.9972004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9972004","Internet of Things;Sensors;Transducers;Actuators;Gateways;Information and Communication Technology (ICT);Smart Grid;SCADA;Substation Automation System (SAS)","Substations;Data analysis;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Internet of Things;Stakeholders;Servers;Reliability","","6","","15","IEEE","12 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the length of the CAS is independent of the number of messages or signatures to be aggregated. This article presents the first pairing-free CAS scheme in certificate-based settings. Due to the certificate-based approach, the proposed scheme is free from key escrow and key distribution problems inherited in identity-based cryptography (IDC) and certificate-less cryptography (CLC), respectively.

The decline in rural farmers and the unsustainable methods of traditional farming practices have spurred the emergence of urban farming. Among urban farming techniques, aquaponics systems poise technological integration. The effectiveness of aquaponics relies on a dependable cyber-physical system with Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, integrating IoT devices results in elevated power consumption and increased production costs for fish and vegetables due to the constant need for power and uninterrupted connectivity. To address this concern, exploring green IoT strategies and techniques to minimize energy consumption and carbon emissions is imperative. Therefore, we employed an innovative modeling and simulation approach to investigate the potential of optimizing sensor placement and sampling rates' impact on energy consumption within an IoT architecture deployed in a commercial-sized multi-loop aquaponics system at Metro Farm (Downtown East, Singapore). The IoT architectures were modeled and simulated using the VisualSim software package.

Internet of Things is the emerging application of CPS. The main research challenge in designing CPS devices and systems is the quantification of complex system behaviors, such as consciousness, adaptation, and evolution. Particularly trust becomes an important element that affects system behavior in the networked society. To capture the unique human societal and systems aspects of trustworthiness quantification for CPS, in this paper, trustworthiness is measured by the perceptions of ability, benevolence, and integrity quantitatively. Ability measures one's sensing and reasoning capability and influence to others. Benevolence captures the genuineness of intention and the extent of reciprocity in information exchange. Integrity provides the confidence about system dependability and predictability. A generic probabilistic graph model is developed to represent CPS functionality at mesoscale and demonstrate the perception-based quantification of ability and benevolence. Trust-based CPS network design and optimization are also demonstrated with the metrics of ability and benevolence.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2822677","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-1663227); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8329991","Ability;benevolence;cyber-physical systems (CPS);graph theory;information exchange;integrity;network architecture;security and privacy;sensor fusion;trust;trustworthiness","Security;Measurement;Internet of Things;Sensors;Probabilistic logic;Privacy;Cognition","","32","","67","IEEE","3 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, security has become a key challenge for the wide deployment of IoT: because of the environmental influences, the IoT data are inherently noisy. Moreover, the IoT devices may be compromised by attackers to intentionally generate fake data. Finally, the underlying wireless network can also be subverted. To address the security issue in IoT, we propose a policy-based secure and trustworthy sensing scheme for IoT named RealAlert, in which the trustworthiness of both data and the IoT devices are evaluated based on both the reporting history and the context in which the data are collected using policy rules.

The system of systems is composed of multiple platforms cooperating with each other to jointly perform system of systems missions, which are usually divided into multiple stages. Due to different mission requirements in different stages, the correlation relationship between platforms in the system of systems is time-varying. Traditional modeling methods, such as reliability block diagram model, fault tree model, and GO model, find it difficult to model the time-varying correlation relationship. In the dynamic models, Markov model can not model dynamic correlation relationships between platforms within the system of systems. Petri net model is difficult to provide accurate evaluation results for complex systems. Therefore, in this paper, the Kill chain network model is established to simulate and model system of systems missions. Firstly, the system of systems is regarded as a network, and platforms are regarded as various nodes. Secondly, define the nodes and edges of the network, and conduct mission reliability model, including network structure modeling and network behavior modeling. Finally, define criteria for mission success and evaluate mission reliability using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The modeling and evaluation method of this paper has the following innovative points and advantages. Firstly, it can model time-varying correlation relationships between platforms for multi-stage mission. Secondly, compared to reliability block diagram model, which only provides one mission reliability value, the mission reliability evaluated by proposed method changes over time. This supports both reliability design and evaluation, as well as synchronous simulation evaluation of reality and the model.","2575-2642","979-8-3503-2998-8","10.1109/ICRMS59672.2023.00087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10712420","Multi-Stage Mission Reliability of The System of Systems;Kill Chain Network;Time-Varying Correlation;Reliability Modeling and Evaluation","Correlation;Monte Carlo methods;Petri nets;Reliability engineering;Safety;Complex systems;Time-varying systems;Faces;System of systems;Fault trees","","","","9","IEEE","21 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, designing a secure and resilient WES is critical. This paper first proposes a system-of-systems (SoS) framework for the cyber-physical WES. Specifically, on the one hand, we adopt a game-theoretic model to capture the interactions between the WES system defender and the adversary at the cyber layer. The outcome of this cyber defense game is reflected by control-aware Nash equilibria. On the other hand, we devise a cyber-aware robust and resilient switching controller based on a Markov jump linear system model for the physical WES. The performances of the WES cyber and physical layers are interdependent due to their natural couplings. We further investigate the SoS equilibrium of the integrated WES, which considers the system security, robustness, and resilience holistically. Finally, we use case studies to corroborate the developed cross-layer design principles for the cyber-physical WES. Note to Practitioners—Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern of wind energy system (WES) operators as an increasing amount of IoT devices are adopted for WES’s communication, monitoring, and operation support purposes. This cyber-physical integration in WES creates a much broader attack surface because adversaries can compromise the physical WES by attacking its dependent cyberspace. To mitigate the impact of attacks, the operator should not only design intelligent control strategies for WES but also strategically secure the WES’s cyber layer. These two goals are naturally coupled together. On the one hand, the WES operates under different compromised conditions depending on the attack actions at the cyber layer. Thus, the control design needs to be adversary-aware by taking the real-time cyber state into account. On the other hand, the adversary’s cyberattack strategy is influenced by the induced performance degradation of WES. Hence, the corresponding attack measures and countermeasures, in turn, should be physically control-aware. This paper establishes a holistic mathematical framework to simultaneously address these two challenging objectives. The obtained solution provides guidelines for the WES operator on the optimal security resource investment in defending against cyberattacks and the robust switching control design to mitigate the impacts of attacks further. This methodology creates a defense-in-depth paradigm for the WES operators to maintain the energy system efficiency in the adversarial environment. This cross-layer design approach is also efficient and user-friendly for online implementation with the developed iterative algorithm. The simulated-based case studies in this paper show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, a more thorough validation of the method in practice is necessary before its integration with the production standard.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3164860","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2138956,ECCS-1847056,CNS-2027884,BCS-2122060); Department of Energy-Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE)(grant numbers:20-19829); Army Research Office (ARO)(grant numbers:W911NF-19-1-0041); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9755939","Wind energy system;cyber-physical security;cross-layer design;switching control;interdependence","Control systems;Switches;Wind energy;Physical layer;Cross layer design;Wind farms;Resilience","","21","","35","IEEE","12 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although the consumer IoT enables users to control many devices and offers conveniences and benefits for daily life, its long-term operation capabilities are subject to a bottleneck related to power management. To save energy and prolong the lifetime of an IoT system, the basic idea is to allow idle devices to go to sleep. Because excessively frequent switching between the awake and asleep phases will consume a significant amount of power, it is essential to properly schedule the order of multiple communication streams among multiple devices such that the total number of wake-up events is as small as possible. Based on the typical communication protocols deployed in IoT systems, this problem can be divided into two cases: 1) the inter-superframe case and the 2) intrasuperframe case. The former case has been well studied in existing works, whereas research on the latter case is currently immature. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme for addressing the stream order scheduling (SOS) problem in the intrasuperframe case. Mobile edge computing technology is utilized in the proposed scheme to reduce the network load, and three heuristic algorithms are proposed to improve the scheme's performance.

Additionally, interdependencies between the systems play another critical role in determining the infrastructure robustness specified by its survival probability. In this paper, we develop game-theoretic models between a defender and an attacker for a generic system of systems using inherent parameters and conditional survival probabilities that characterize the interdependencies. We derive Nash Equilibrium conditions for the cases of interdependent and independent systems of systems under sum-form utility functions. We derive expressions for the infrastructure survival probability that capture its dependence on cost and system parameters, and also on dependencies that are specified by conditional probabilities. We apply the results to cyber-physical systems which show the effects on system survival probability due to defense and attack intensities, inherent robustness, unit cost, target valuation, and interdependencies.","","978-0-9964-5270-0","10.23919/ICIF.2017.8009876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8009876","","Robustness;Games;System of systems;Biological system modeling;Mathematical model;Nash equilibrium;Security","","","","35","","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MCPS are a type of cyber-physical system with intelligent control that may be realized by cyber components, human operators or a combination of the two. Traditional systems engineering modeling and design methodologies are not adequate for representing the intelligent behaviors exhibited by MCPS without early commitment to design solutions. As a result, many of the important design decisions made during conceptual design have inadequate model support. This paper presents an agent-based model framework specifically for MCPS during conceptual design. The agents are abstract logical components corresponding to elements of the MCPS vehicle. An important part of the model is representation of goals as a driver of intelligent behaviors. We describe the model using a current Army system, the Palletized Loading System (PLS).","","978-1-7281-0457-7","10.1109/SYSOSE.2019.8753866","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753866","","","","1","","18","USGov","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the limitations of IoT devices, such as small sizes and poor security, weaken the Water Distribution System (WDS) security, and many attackers compromise the critical components of WDS. Cyber-physical attacks (CPAs) are considered one of the biggest challenges that decrease the security factors in WDS by disrupting normal operations and tampering with the critical data of the water system. For instance, an attacker can change the water pump’s speed, disrupting the service. An attacker can also alter the data of water quality parameters to contaminate the water. It is important to propose solutions to increase security in the WDS and defend against CPAs and security threats. Although several intrusion detection methods were proposed in the literature to detect WDS CPAs, many issues still need solutions, such as detecting attacks with smaller false alarms, minimizing the time to disclose the attacks, determining the location of the compromising components, and recovering solutions for the attacked components. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on a deep learning algorithm called a Conditional variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to disclose CPAs and mitigate their bad effects on WDS. The proposed method consists of a neural network, an encoder to compress data, and a decoder to decompress data. The objective goal is to minimize the reconstruction error between the encoded-decoded data and the initial data. We apply the CVAE on some well-known datasets. The experiment results show that our proposed CVAE method performs better than others. After analyzing the CVAE model with other existing models, we get the highest performance by reaching %98 accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3384295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10488365","Internet of Things (IoT);security;water distribution systems (WDSs);supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA);cyber-physical attacks (CPAs);autoencoder (AE);variational autoencoder (VAE);conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE)","Security;Internet of Things;Water resources;Water pollution;Sensors;SCADA systems;Actuators;Cyber-physical systems;Encoding","","","","51","CCBYNCND","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve this problem, this work developed a prototype-guided PDA method with momentum weight for fault diagnosis. Specifically, to reduce the risk of ruling out the outlier by the output of a classifier or a discriminator, a classwise selectively source weighting strategy that follows the number of the target pseudo labels is proposed. The target instances’ pseudo labels, which are obtained by calculating the distance between the target instance and the source prototypes, are irrelevant to the classifier and discriminator. Furthermore, the momentum algorithm, by which the historical weights information could be retained, is employed in the source weights calculation procedure to alleviate the fluctuation and more closely to the global optimal.

Although semantic interoperability has received increased attention in the recent days, the current IoT systems lack means for testing that. This paper describes our approach for semantic interoperability testing in the IoT. We have identified three main requirements for semantic tests - (i) lexical check, (ii) syntactic check and (iii) semantic checks. To examine semantic interoperability between IoT systems, we define two types of tests - (i) semantic conformance test and (ii) interoperability test.

In such environments, economic transactions between system components are used to pay for data and services. Blockchain-based overlay networks have been developed to provide such financial mechanism for IoT devices with sufficient processing power and operating system support. However, no practical solutions for low-end devices exist. In addition, existing solutions also require setting up multiple blockchain accounts for a single administrative domain, which incurs high fees when consolidating those accounts. In this paper, we propose a Ticket-Based Verification Protocol, which defines two separate logical entities, contract manager and transaction verifier.

Furthermore, some selected case studies are conducted to examine attacks on representative DT-based CPS (smart grid, smart transportation, and smart manufacturing).

The research is relevant from the point of view of safety and energy saving of mining operations, since the process of ventilation of underground mining companies consumes from 30 to 50% of all company electricity. Existing methods of ventilation control often do not ensure rational energy consumption, as they do not take into account the dynamics of air distribution and changes in environmental parameters. The proposed method includes basic algorithms for calculating the interrelationship of physical parameters of general natural draught between the trunks. The method includes: calculation of the draught’s power; calculation of productivity and the choice of the required mode of operation for the main fan unit (MFU) considering the inertia of the ventilation system; dynamic calculation of the control signal on the fan unit taking into account the impact of the general natural draught. The method is focused on the implementation of the TICK stack used to create IoT applications as part of the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) for ventilation based on the InfluxData platform. The proposed CPS architecture consists of four subsystems: physical object subsystem, IoT network and computing infrastructure - ICT infrastructure, digital twin, user interface. CPS architecture provides processing of data from energy meters, controllers and air environment parameters, implemented in on-line and off-line calculation units.","","978-1-7281-4590-7","10.1109/ICIEAM48468.2020.9111995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9111995","Cyber-Physical System;Information System Architecture;Internet of Things;Digital Twin;InfluxData Platform;Modelica","Productivity;Fans;Digital twin;Heuristic algorithms;Atmospheric modeling;Computer architecture;Companies","","15","","27","IEEE","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those in turn are driven by a societal threats such as impacts on environment, sustainability of energy & natural resources, globalization, and rapidly changing market trends. A specific case of automation system engineering, concerns with the reengineering of old systems, in order to upgrade to a newer technology version; is referred as “Migration”. The engineering process of automation systems is a challenging job; in which, it's required to realize and formulate the desired functionality and turn it into a physical system that fulfills the required process objectives, consequently selection of the most suitable engineering tools and methodologies to achieve that objectives. Although, most engineering specializations and application domains have developed a standardized engineering tools and methods. However, these standards vary greatly because the interaction between different specializations and domains are limited. Therefore, there are a continued efforts for having a common and unified ones. The other challenge in the engineering process is due to the increased complexity of automation systems, and accordingly, increased functionalities and amount data processing. These challenges makes the use of new technologies, engineering tools and methodologies to become a task that must be faced. In the context of the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0), the development and adaptation of more smart, more inter-connected automation systems, is a coherent approach to the engineering and management of the System of Systems (SOS). That system, which connects a massive numbers of devices, expected to be operating across multiple automation domains and serving different specializations. The SOS will utilize the industry 4.0 technologies such as internet of things (IoT), cyber physical systems (CPS) and cloud computing. In the same context; the engineering of SOS has to consider critical challenges faced by the legacy automation systems such as: 1) integration with the aforementioned technologies. 2) Interoperability between varies IoT devices and existing system. 3) Guarantee of stable performance of the system in regards to latency, availability and real-time information transfer. 4) Scalability and safety of process know-how and automation system related information. 5) Ease of application. 6) Feasibility of multi-vendor and multi-stakeholders integration.

Conventional electrical grids often leave consumers unaware of their energy usage patterns, resulting in both energy wastage and financial loss. To enhance energy efficiency, the consumption patterns of consumers need regulation. Smart Grids efficiently employs Demand-Side Management (DSM) strategies, including peak clipping, load shifting, and consumer awareness campaigns, to optimize energy consumption and achieve energy savings. DSM’s synergy with smart meters and smart energy management systems (SEMS) emerges as a powerful trio in comprehensive energy conservation and optimization. The integration of SEMS with the Internet of Things (IoT), augmented by the advancements in 5G technology, emerges as a transformative paradigm. SEMS, operating within the IoT ecosystem bolstered by 5G connectivity, facilitates the instantaneous and efficient integration of IoT in SEMS, enabling real-time data collection, in-depth analysis, and data-driven decisions for optimal energy management. This empowers users with the ability to make data-driven decisions, yielding tangible outcomes in the form of efficacy, cost reductions, and fortified sustainability initiatives. We present a SEMS that amalgamates three microcontroller units to create a smart meter that is further integrated with a cloud-based middleware module and consumer API. Furthermore, it collects vital power metrics such as voltage, current, kWh, kW, and PF. Consumers can conveniently access this data in real-time via an API. Energy service companies can leverage this data for incentive programs and to motivate customers to optimize their energy consumption. These datasets serve as a foundational element for the development of diverse DSM strategies. This research work presents the deployment, and performance evaluation of an IoT-based SEMS that is implemented in diverse settings, including industrial, commercial, building, and warehouse setups. Moreover, as a test case, our evaluation extends to the specific conservation of energy within air-conditioning systems.

IoT devices are smart devices designed with simple functions in mind, like collecting the temperature or opening a door. However, IoT devices lack a good security layer due to lack of resources: small memory, processor and/or battery. Consequently, new potential attacks and security problems have arisen. In order to detect and mitigate these security problems Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)can be used, However, abnormal traffic must be distinguished from normal IoT patterns. In this article, a study was done on characterization of traffic signatures of two typical IoT application protocols - MQTT and MQTTS - with the objective of generating and collecting IP flows of said traffic. An IoT application scenario was simulated and using the traffic collected, an analysis of MQTT and MQTTS flows were elaborated to identify flow-based signatures that could be used to identify the network traffic of IoT application protocols.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760849","Cibersecurity;flow monitoring;network intrusion detection;Internet of Things;MQTT;MQTTS","Internet of Things;Protocols;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Cryptography;Open systems","","2","","12","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, such connected devices could be found everywhere, from home appliances to industrial control systems and environmental monitoring applications. One of the main challenges in IoT infrastructures is that of reliability, which emboldens itself in the context of Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLN) as they are inherently prone to packet loss as a result of their environmental and design constraints. Therefore, reliability of IoT devices becomes crucially important. With communication, the most important consideration in these infrastructures, the reliability of the links plays the main role in the overall reliability of the system. An aspect of link reliability lies within the modulation and encoding schemes used for the transmission of data. There are various types of such methods supported by the de facto IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, but few of them are in actual widespread deployment. In this paper, we explore three of these modulation schemes along with four of the well-known encoding techniques for three different deployment scenarios and then we evaluate the results to propose the most admirable couple for establishing a reliable communication infrastructure in IoT applications.","2472-8586","978-1-7281-3902-9","10.1109/AICT47866.2019.8981775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981775","Internet of Things;Modulation;Encoding;Reliability","","","5","","29","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper analyzes the technical issues of run-time operation and emergent behavior of S-CPSs, reviews the current understanding and state of advancement in designing S-CPSs for run-time, explores the paradox, and issues of designing for run-time adaptation, and synthesizes some general principles that can be taken into consideration when addressing the challenges, first of all, in the context of advanced manufacturing systems. This paper introduces four levels of CPSs according to reasoning capabilities and adaptation freedom of systems, and recognizes the paradox that a system with a higher level of freedom requires a higher level of self-control and resource management according to the overall objective of operation. Specific and common design principles are presented and critically assessed for each advancement level of CPSs.

Furthermore, various radio access technologies have been created for IoT devices facilitating their IP networking as well.

Most of today,s machines, e.g., automotive engines, production machinery or even consumer devices, such as a washing machine, are controlled by an embedded computer system. It is assumed that the widespread integration of these existing embedded computer systems and data bases into systems-ofsystems (e.g., the Internet of Things, IoT) will provide new synergistic services, make better use of the available information, lead to new insights, improve current economic processes and thus create greater wealth. Fueled by the dramatic technological progress in the area of wire-bound and wire-less communication, this integration is already happening on a wide scale in industry. From the viewpoint of computer science, the domain of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) is a relatively new field that poses significant new research challenges. In our view, the differentiating characteristics of a SoS compared to a monolithic system are the autonomy of the Constituent Systems (CS), emergent phenomena at the SoS level, uncoordinated evolution of the CSs and most, importantly, that the occurrence of faults in the CSs must be considered normal during the operation an SoS.

A recurring problem is the emergence of siloed IoT platforms due to proprietary standards. Recently, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) proposed a human-readable and machine- understandable format called Thing Description (TD). It allows to uniformly describe device and service interfaces of different IoT standards with syntactic and semantic information, and hence enables semantic interoperability. However, describing sequential behavior of devices, which is essential for many cyber-physical systems, is not covered. In this paper, we propose a systematic way to describe such sequential behavior as an extension within TDs, thereby increasing their semantic expressiveness through possible, valid state transitions. This enables safe and desired operation of devices as well as scalability by modeling systems as sequential compositions of Things. We show in a case study that previously unmodelable behavior can now be expressed and the overall manual intervention requirements of state-of-the-art implementations can be significantly reduced.","1636-9874","978-1-5386-6418-6","10.1109/FDL.2018.8524065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8524065","Internet of Things;Thing Description;CPS;Model-driven development;System Testing","Standards;Data structures;Vocabulary;Internet of Things;Semantics;Ventilation;Protocols","","6","","13","IEEE","8 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Internet of Things is used in a variety of areas, from controlling household appliances to monitoring the condition of objects in industry and agriculture. The MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol was used in this work, which is a lightweight protocol for transmitting messages in IoT networks. It allows for efficient data exchange between devices, ensuring low energy consumption and minimizing bandwidth. The following ciphers were used to ensure the security of information in IoT networks: ASCON and Grain128-AEAD. ASCON is used to encrypt and authenticate data, ensuring its confidentiality and integrity. Grain128-AEAD is also used for data protection, providing a high level of security and encryption. This research work simulates an IoT environment based on the MQTT communication protocol and tests the performance of lightweight cryptographic algorithms. As evident from the results, encryption is an essential part of security for IoT -based communication systems and such lightweight algorithms could help in boosting the overall performance with low to none cases of failure.

Though it sounds promising, there are very limited formal techniques to define IIoT architectures. In this paper, an emerging international standard called the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF), its potential application to capture IIoT architectures, its ability to help the systems integrator to develop interoperable systems, with traceability to requirements and across different viewpoints, is analyzed.

Consequently, it gives rise to cyber-attacks and data theft. The consequences of these malicious activities can be life-threatening. Therefore, organizations must identify these threats to implement proactive and reactive measures. Digital Forensics of medical devices focuses on reactive measures to generate evidence of unprecedented events presented in court. Digital forensics, in combination with ML, might aid in the development of a secure MIoT system that can detect cyber-attacks and provide evidence for the legal process. Implementing digital forensics in medical systems is challenging, given their complex functioning. This paper presents a novel methodology for developing a forensic-ready MIoT system with two distinct approaches: an intrusion detection system and modeling of the physiological data.

Therefore, we introduce a new concept of computation reloading, that is, resource-rich servers allocate tasks to sensor devices with stronger computing capacity. Most previous real-time EC researches have not considered sensor devices’ higher spatial–temporal mobility, which results in continuous computation migration and high delay. In this article, we expose a computation reloading scheme driven by spatial–temporal mobility (CRSM), for single time slice and multiple time slices cases, computation tasks are allocated in advance by predicting sensor devices locations.

There are multiple independent linear time-invariant processes in the system, which are sampled by sensors, scheduled by controllers, and controlled by actuators. In the literature of wireless control CPS, commonly assume that the system just have one controller and ignore the processing time on server. In this work we employ the edge computing, the controllers are facilitated by edge server and cloud server. The processing time of status update depends on the characteristic of different servers and processes. By taking into account such conditions, we mainly investigate how to choose the destination of status updates (i.e., edge server or cloud server) to minimize the average mean square error (MSE) of the entire system. To address this issue, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) problem and obtain the optimal scheduling policy. The threshold property of the optimal scheduling policy is proved, and a suboptimal policy is proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, the processing preemption mechanism is considered to schedule the status updates more flexibly, and its consistency property is proved. The simulation results illustrate that the selection of controller is related to the timeliness of process and show the superiority of the proposed policies.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3161356","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1806403); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871147,61831008,62071141); Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Plan(grant numbers:GXWD20201230155427003-20200730122528002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739691","Age of Information (AoI);cyber-physical system (CPS);edge computing;Internet of Things (IoT);multiprocess;preemption","Servers;Process control;Task analysis;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;Wireless communication","","4","","35","IEEE","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, the needs of patients with chronic diseases are increasing and becoming more complex and multi-faceted; they require addressing not only the physical body, but also behavioral, emotional, and spiritual health. The current healthcare delivery system organically developed to address acute conditions, primarily injury and infection during the mid-19th century, a time when the body was viewed as a machine. This led to the organization of the healthcare delivery system by organ systems into specialties and departments. However, the healthcare delivery system today needs to provide healthcare services that span multiple systems to provide the care patients need. Such care requires services from multiple specialties (e.g., podiatry and endocrinology for diabetes, primary care and psychiatry for behavioral health, and palliative care MDs and chaplains & social workers for end-of-life care) that each effectively functions as its own system. There are currently several limitations and difficulties in designing patient-oriented healthcare services utilizing a system of systems framework. First, clinical models describe the service with a focus on resources. Second, the description tends to be at a high-level of abstraction, leaving the details to the implementer. Finally, the patient is generally modeled as an operand non-participatory agent, being pushed and pulled through the system. This paper describes the use of engineering and systems principles to design patient-oriented healthcare services that provide detail and quantification that classic services do not model. In doing so, these designed system of system models incorporate the detail, data quantification and implementation level information to allow for the success of the clinical aspect of the model to be achieved. This paper presents a medical based description of a system of systems and the engineered system based description of an integrated patient-oriented service.","","978-1-5386-4876-6","10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428716","","Modeling;Radio frequency;System of systems;Transportation;Personnel;Diseases","","6","","31","IEEE","9 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These physical objects after getting connected to the Internet can provide smart services and are therefore known as smart objects. For the realization of IoT, it is necessary for the smart objects to discover and interact each other without human intervention. The number of smart objects connected to IoT are increasing at a rapid rate, creating an overhead for the users of controlling these many smart objects. One smart solution to this problem is the use of Context-Aware Communication. This work aims to propose Enhanced Context-Aware CoAP Extension for smart objects discovery in Internet of Things (IoT), namely ECTX-CoAP, which is enhancement of CoAP-CTX [2]. CoAP-CTX is able to do Context-Aware discovery of smart objects but at the cost of discovery response time. The enhancement to CoAP-CTX is made by first, reducing discovery response time, comparable to CoAP and second, by adding the concept of Group Communication functionality to it other than multi-casting. The proposed ECTX-CoAP is implemented in Contiki using Cooja simulator. The experimental results show that the proposed enhancement has successfully reduced the discovery time and number of messages exchanged, also allowing users to access a group of smart objects efficiently.","","978-1-5386-8215-9","10.1109/INFOCOMTECH.2018.8722425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8722425","Internet of Things;smart objects;discovery;CoAP;CoAP-CTX;Group Communication","Internet of Things;Protocols;Servers;Temperature sensors;Time factors","","","","9","IEEE","27 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, data transmission using a large number of hops causes more delay. In light of this, in this work, a novel method of energy and throughput management in a delay-constrained small-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-IoT network is proposed. The proposed small-world framework optimizes the number of hops required for the data transmission leading to improved energy efficiency and quality of service. The method introduces optimal long-range links between device pairs resulting in low average path length and high clustering coefficient which are called as small-world characteristics. Therefore, in this work, UAVs are deployed to collect the data from IoT devices and forward it to the ground station (GS) utilizing the small world framework. It is shown through results that the network delays corresponding to the proposed method, conventional routing method, low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol, modified LEACH protocol, and canonical particle multiswarm (CPMS) method are 789.39, 1602.53, 1000.92, 873.63, and 999.79 s, respectively. It is also observed that the number of dead UAVs in case of the proposed method is reduced when compared to other existing methods. It is also noticed that the proposed method results in 100% packet delivery ratio (PDR) dominating LEACH and modified LEACH protocols. Thus, it is shown that the proposed method outperforms the other shortest path methods in terms of network latency, lifetime, and PDR. Further, the effect of location of GS, velocities of UAVs, and hovering heights of UAVs is considered for the performance evaluation of the proposed method. The obtained results validate the significance of utilization of the proposed method over various network scenarios.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3231644","Indo-Norwegian Collaboration in Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (INCAPS) Project of the INTPART Program(grant numbers:287918); Low-Altitude UAV Communication and Tracking (LUCAT) Project of the IKTPLUSS Program(grant numbers:280835); Norges Forskningsråd; Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Government of India, through the Project “Design and Development of Cognitive Small-World LPWANs for Internet of Things Towards Health Monitoring”(grant numbers:SRG/2021/000137); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998008","Energy efficiency;multihop data routing;network latency;small-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-Internet of Things (IoT) network;throughput","Internet of Things;Delays;Throughput;Protocols;Data communication;Wireless networks;Routing","","16","","60","IEEE","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automating the process of CPS management requires that AI and secure transaction processing be integrated within all stakeholders, including the cloud, fog, edge, network, storage, and industrial devices. This integration necessitates the distribution and decentralization of the self-configuring, self-managing, self-healing, and self-governing process in CPS.

A two-stage federated learning (FL) algorithm, where during the first stage, industrial devices are grouped into clusters and perform local ML training. Local models are shared with network edge devices and a set of global models are created using FL averaging. During the second stage, a main global model is created from the distributed first-stage global models using a FL aggregating algorithm. Blockchain is used to verify and validate the trained models on the edge. System evaluations are performed to compare the proposed HFL solution against traditional FL in terms of training accuracy and network overhead.","","978-1-6654-8764-1","10.1109/BalkanCom55633.2022.9900546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900546","Blockchain;Cyber-physical systems;Federated Learning;Industry 4.0","Training;Performance evaluation;Federated learning;Clustering algorithms;Cyber-physical systems;Blockchains;Fourth Industrial Revolution","","8","","10","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, given the limited path resources and congestion problems, an evaluation index based on path arc time loss is proposed and applied to the path network modeling. Second, an improved heuristic path planning algorithm is deployed to each mobile robot, including two evaluation indicators: time loss and destination distance. Innovative hierarchical scheduling strategies-map state evaluation, collision avoidance, and path planning, are deployed in different layers of ICPS, which significantly improves computational efficiency.

With IoT devices having to execute thousands of operations per second, it has become difficult for centralized systems to handle such platforms. Also, factors like operational and maintenance cost of these server machines and danger of DoS(Denial of Service) attack on such servers has threatened the practitioners to come up with a more distributed way of storing the contents. With its decentralized and privacy preserving features, blockchain technology fits well into the scheme of things. This mitigates the quintessential challenges faced in most of the centralized systems. In this paper, we are focusing on the new firmware update scheme to perform the update operations securely. We propose a blockchain based solution for managing firmware updates in IoT. Improper management of devices and distribution of firmware updates from the device vendor could sabotage the IoT ecosystem. The objective of this proposed scheme is to verify and distribute the firmware binaries securely to the IoT device deployed by the device vendor. The PUSH-based method is used for a firmware update in which verification of firmware is done by Hash Chain. It preserves the integrity of firmware by linking the latest version information by previous versions information with the help of a smart contract mechanism.","2575-7288","978-1-5386-9533-3","10.1109/ICACCS.2019.8728389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8728389","Internet of Things;Blockchain;Smart Contracts;Firmware Update","Blockchain;Internet of Things;Security;Ecosystems;Logic gates","","13","","20","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a solution for the Localization of health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment (LoCATE) system, which allows tracking patients and medical staff in near real time. LoCATE makes use of the current 802.11 wireless networks within a health-care facility and edge node technology as its tracking technique. The edge nodes continuously communicate with the infrastructure's wireless network Access Points (APs)in a nonintrusive manner. The data, collected from the APs by the edge nodes, is processed by a calculation algorithm based on the signal strength to locate the person in possession of the edge node within a reasonable range of variability.

It is expanding its horizon with a fast pace. Internet is rightly defined as “network of networks”. It is, in most simple terms, a means of establishing a connection between your computer and any other computer globally through servers and some dedicated routers. The major form of communication of current Internet is among humans (i.e. human-to-human). The next upcoming form of communication that uses Internet as the underlying technology is The Internet of Things (IoT). IoT extends the capabilities of Internet to enable machine-to-machine communication (M2M).Therefore, IoT can be said to provide communication among everyone and everything. IoT enables us to embed some sort of intelligence in the objects that are or can be connected to the Internet in order to exchange information, hence communicate, invoke certain actions based on inputs, take decisions and provide useful services. In this paper, the basic underlying workflow of IoT is discussed and the architecture of IoT is explained. The paper also highlights the most useful technologies of these days, which employ IoT for their functioning. Further, the applications and features of IoT are mentioned in the paper. Lastly, the issues and challenges in implementing the IoT are briefly discussed.

To set up a network with a large number of devices in the constrained environment can be a challenge. Also, collecting, storing and analyzing data generated from sensors attached to the devices most often requires developing custom-made applications which imply time and cost consumption. Several cloud providers are offering IoT services that unite needed features into full solution offering connectivity between devices and the cloud, processing of data sent from devices and interaction with connected devices through the application. One of them is AWS IoT (Amazon Internet of Things) which is fully scalable, reliable and simple to use. This platform can collect data from a large number of different devices and connect them to endpoints for other tools, allowing a developer to tie received data into the independent application. Other aspects, like security, resource management, integration and centralized management are also covered.

Furthermore, it is hard to achieve a secure transmission as the microprocessor-based IoT nodes do not have enough computing power. Edge computing in IoT (edge-IoT) promises low bandwidth and secure transmission. Edge-IoT is the ability of a node to perform high computation before sending its data. Thus, instead of sending raw data, an edge node is sending a post-processed the data with much lower bandwidth. An edge-IoT node also can perform a complex encryption computation before the transmission to secure the data. This paper proposes an edge-IoT using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) as an IoT node.

As complex algorithms cannot be implemented on the resource-constrained IoT devices, research in the aforementioned areas is still an active subject. In this paper, we propose a mutual device and server authentication protocol using Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for IoT devices. PUFs can be used to uniquely identify the devices and can also be used to generate random keys. As the name suggests, the keys generated by the PUFs cannot be reproduced.

Since the latency is dependent on the number of IoT devices in the network, the way that each device generates its traffic, and many other factors, it is extremely challenging to accurately estimate the latency.

The secret key is used during substitution and transposition operations to encrypt IoT-generated data that is suitable for the IoT computational resources. The experimental result of the enhanced DNA algorithm shows remarkable outcomes regarding key size, encryption time, and proportion of distortion compared with other encryption algorithms.","","978-1-6654-5436-0","10.1109/ICEMIS56295.2022.9914290","Middle East University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9914290","Internet of Things;Data security;Privacy Encryption;DNA","Image segmentation;Wireless networks;DNA;Distortion;Encryption;Internet of Things","","3","","29","IEEE","13 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, data management and device interaction for IoT devices are centralized, with a central server managing the storage functions. As a novel data storage solution, blockchain technology offers security through its inherent features, such as distributivity, decentralization, immutability, and consensus mechanisms. Consensus mechanisms represents the rule set imposed by the blockchain network on the IoT devices to enhance network security. In this paper, we analyzed three types of consensus mechanisms - Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Authority - to determine which is best suited for use in IoT data storage solution that uses blockchain. Thus, we evaluated the consensus mechanisms on public blockchain test networks using three metrics: transaction latency, average block time, and average query time. Our obtained results show the PoS and PoA consensus mechanisms are more appropriate for IoT, exhibiting lower transaction latency, lower average block time and query time when compared to the PoW mechanism. This suggests that PoS and PoA are promising alternatives for blockchain-based IoT systems that require energy-efficient and low-latency transactions.","2159-3604","979-8-3503-3193-6","10.1109/ATEE58038.2023.10108211","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10108211","Blockchain;Consensus mechanisms;Internet of Things;Blockchain Testnets;Proof of Stake;Proof of Authority;Proof of Work","Performance evaluation;Memory;Computer architecture;Network security;Proof of Work;Consensus protocol;Internet of Things","","2","","25","IEEE","28 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the lack of a standardised and universally accepted IoT implementation framework, conventional information technology (IT) security measures are applied to the heterogeneous stack of IoT technologies. However, IT security measures cannot always be directly applied to IoT security requirements. Thus, the transmission of data through the IoT network layer becomes inevitably vulnerable to attack. This paper proposes the application of data diodes to enhance the data security of the heterogeneous stack of IoT technologies. The paper also proposes the possibility of bringing IoT security to the edge (devices) by embedding miniature data diodes within IoT devices. Data diodes are hardware-based security measures that enforce only one way data flow.

Studies indicate that most of the existing IoT devices have inherent security flaws and are vulnerable to both internal and external attacks. Threat identification is generally done by either identification of the specific type of attack in the network or by distinguishing benign traffic from anomalous traffic. Most of the recent works for threat identification rely on supervised machine learning techniques which involve training a model using datasets containing labeled samples of prior attacks. A supervised network can thus only understand the categories on which it has been trained. Due to the enormous volume and variety of data collected by the IoT devices, and the attacks to which the networks are prone, the supervised techniques are of limited use in practical applications. We propose a novel threat identification strategy using the Clustering based Variational Autoencoder (CVA) for detecting threats (anomalous behaviors) in IoT networks. The proposed strategy uses an unsupervised technique and hence the model needs to be trained only on traffic under benign scenarios for the identification of threats. Also, the proposed technique is scalable to accommodate a large number of devices.","2325-9418","978-1-6654-7350-7","10.1109/INDICON56171.2022.10039898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039898","Anomaly detection;Variational Autoencoder;Threat Intelligence;Internet of Things;Unsupervised learning","Training;Machine learning;Data models;Behavioral sciences;Internet of Things;Security;Unsupervised learning","","1","","14","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Internet of Things has the potential to speed up the process of automating several industries, including the automotive, transportation, production, and advertising sectors. Large-scale IIoT systems will have security difficulties when its benefits become clear, leading to repeated large-scale attacks that damage key infrastructure or fraudulent transactions. The system is additionally challenged by the vast quantity of connected devices and the consequent constraints on available resources (such as their battery life, memory, and processing power). Traditional communication and networking flaws are also present in the IIoT, but it takes more work to tailor security solutions to secure critical industrial control systems. These flaws are carried over to the IIoT. While there is some literature on the topics of security, privacy, and trust in IIoT systems, a more thorough examination of the many moving parts that make up an IIoT system is lacking. This study compares IoT security vulnerabilities to solve the problem. We explore several IIoT security difficulties and criteria.

The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various applications is that they have tremendously appealing features, e.g., low production cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation, autonomous and longtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability in sensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the IoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the Internet. Hence, the security of IoT should start with foremost securing WSNs ahead of the other components. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e., there is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the flowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big concern to the scientific community. More specifically, for the application areas in which CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) has prime importance, WSNs and emerging IoT technology might constitute an open avenue for the attackers. Besides, recent integration and collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms of security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks. Therefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated into mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are investigated under that umbrella: “Passive Attacks” and “Active Attacks”. Understanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help paving a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT technology.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2019.2953364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897627","Blockchain;CoAP;cryptography;detection;DoS;intrusion;IoT;MQTT;prevention;RPL;survey;TSCH;WSN;6LowPAN;6LowPSec;6TiSCH","Wireless sensor networks;Security;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Wireless communication;Privacy","","451","","188","IEEE","13 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, a distributed authentication architecture in which a base station in radio access networks authenticates IoT devices locally is presented. In addition, a cross-layer authentication protocol is designed with a novel integration strategy under the distributed authentication architecture, where PLA, which employs physical features for authentication, is used as preemptive authentication in the proposed protocol.

In this context, smart parking systems are suitable solutions to avoid the traffic congestion, the air pollution and the long search to find a free parking spot. The inclusion of emergent ICT technologies and artificial intelligence techniques, and particularly using multi-agent systems, combined under the scope of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), ensure flexibility, modularity, adaptability and the decentralization of intelligence through autonomous, cooperative and proactive entities. Such smart parking systems can be easily adapted to any type of vehicle to be parked and scalable in terms of the number of parking spots and drivers/vehicles. A fundamental issue in these agent-based CPS parking systems is the interconnection between the cyber and physical counterparts, i.e. between the software agents and the physical asset controllers to access the parking spots. This paper focuses on developing an agent-based CPS for a smart parking system and particularly addressing how the software agents are interconnected with the physical asset controllers using proper Internet of Things technologies.

A successful platform must balance sufficient commonality to support economical reuse, while also providing variability and extensibility to enable innovation in system and system of systems (SoS) capabilities. These commonality/variability tradeoffs for SoS platforms are frequently tacit decisions, since there are no accepted techniques for analyzing such decisions at the scale and degree of requirements uncertainty that characterize most SoSs. The objective of our work is to develop a method for analyzing decisions about requirements for common platforms for SoSs. The method begins with the requirements tasks of identifying and selecting appropriate variabilities (variation points, variation ranges, and variation decision binding times) to support immediate SoS needs, and also enable innovation and controlled evolution. We are currently conducting a workshop and interviews with SoS experts to define the essential technical problems in SoS common platform development and identify solution constraints. We will then define a simplified SoS with limited capability requirements to use as a model problem. We will use the model problem to assess the fit of existing scope, commonality, and variability methods from software product lines to the SoS context, and extend existing economic models using real options and probabilistic models to model uncertainty in evolution requirements. While it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of our approach, it is based on proven technologies from the mature field of software product lines and so we have confidence that we can build successful SoS techniques from this foundation.","","978-1-4673-4379-4","10.1109/RES4.2012.6347693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6347693","system of systems;software requirements;platform engineering;software product lines;system of systems architecture","Software;Economics;Computer architecture;Context;Conferences;Context modeling","","3","","10","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, semantic dependencies between exchanged information play an important role. Due to emergent structure of CPS, this is not plain to accomplish but can be solved by monitoring tools. If several parties are cooperating in a CPS, there is the additional problem that all have to work together to collect those dependency information. In the event of an error, however, the responsible party may no longer want to admit that it caused the error. Therefore, the information required for the investigation must be securely stored so that all parties involved can rely on this information without having to trust the other parties. In this paper, we present our idea of how parties with different interests can cooperate in a CPS without having to trust each other in case of errors. Each party will be separately able to understand dependencies between exchanged information. For this purpose, our approach uses various decentralized storage mechanisms, we particularly also highlight the possibility of using blockchain technology.","","978-1-5386-6585-5","10.1109/ICSA-C.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8432169","information flow monitor;blockchain;trust;semantic dependencies;cps;cyber-physical systems;iot;internet of things","Monitoring;Task analysis;Protocols;Cyber-physical systems;Runtime;History","","3","","15","IEEE","13 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchain applications eliminate the middle man to provide trust and making the processes more efficient & cheaper. It's decentralized nature and cryptographic algorithm make it immune to attack and becomes a secure technology. When the data is stored on the blockchain it becomes immutable, ensuring trust in data. Nevertheless, this does not guarantee the trustworthiness of the device which is generating the data. We propose a blockchain-based signature storage solution to ensure trust among the participants which is further applicable to a diverse range of blockchain-based CPS applications.

We leverage the fact that due to inertia, an adversary cannot destabilize the physical system (even with complete control of the software) in an instantaneous manner; in fact, it often takes finite (even considerable time). This property, coupled with em system-wide restarts is used to enforce a secure (and safe) operational window for the system. A hardware root-of-trust, further decreases the ability for attackers to compromise our mechanisms.

They are used in many computer systems such as Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Conducting research studies on DS is possible with simulation. However, depending on the research context, having access to the proper simulator is challenging. Existing simulation frameworks can be complex and not suitable to study DS outside of commonly seen contexts, such as systems deployed in constrained environments. Often, authors from state of the art rely on building their own simulator. This is a time consuming, delicate and dangerous approach, especially when such simulators are not validated.This paper presents the Extensible Simulator for Distributed Systems (ESDS) in the context of systems deployed in constrained environments. In our case, the Arctic Tundra. This simulation framework is simple to use and suitable for the study of DS. The architecture of the simulation framework is detailed at a fine grain level.

These proxies are analogous to web pages, which proxy a cloud-based service such as a bank, but instead of being designed to interface those services with humans, accessors are designed to interface services and Things with other services and Things. A deterministic DE semantics is combined with a widely used pattern for handling network interactions that we call asynchronous atomic callbacks (AACs). AAC enables many concurrent pending requests to be active at once without blocking and without the treacherous concurrency pitfalls of threads. In effect, our architecture combines AAC with actors where the actor model has been endowed with a temporal semantics.

The scalability and heterogeneity of IoT offer limited protection and is prone to diverse attacks, including WSN-inherited attacks. Moreover, IPv6 routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL), a de facto routing protocol for IoT networks, also suffers from certain vulnerabilities based on its features and functionalities. Researchers have proposed various mitigation mechanisms for secure networks and routing in IoT. Recently, trust-based approaches have gained tremendous interest from the research community to embed security in IoT networks and routing protocols. In the existing literature, several trust models have been introduced according to the security needs of the IoT system, such as SecTrust, DCTM-IoT, CTRUST, etc. In this research, security issues and requirements of IoT networks and RPL routing protocol are studied with respect to various attacks, such as Blackhole, Spoofing, Rank, etc. Additionally, various mitigation methods and significance of trust models in IoT for secure routing are analyzed.

Prime examples like Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 enable new technologies and extend the service capabilities of physical entities by building a universe of connected devices. In addition to higher complexity, the coupling of these heterogeneous systems results in many new challenges, which should be addressed by engineers and administrators. Here, security represents a major challenge, which may be well addressed in cyber-space engineering, but less in embedded system or CPS design. Although model-based engineering provides significant benefits for system architects, like reducing complexity and automated analysis, as well as being considered as standard methodology in embedded systems design, the aspect of security may not have had a major role in traditional engineering concepts. Especially the characteristics of CPS, as well as the coupling of safety-relevant (physical) components with high-scalable entities of the cyber-space domain have an enormous impact on the overall level of security, based on the introduced side effects and uncertainties. Therefore, we aim to define a model-based security-engineering framework, which is tailored to the needs of CPS engineers. Hereby, we focus on the actual modeling process, the evaluation of security, as well as quantitatively expressing security of a deployed CPS.

The eventuality will be a convergence of IT and OT. Until that day comes, cyber practitioners must still deal with the primitive security features of OT networks, maintain a foothold on enterprise and cloud networks, and attempt to instill sound security practices in burgeoning IoT networks.

Conventional security and authentication solutions often fail to meet IoT security requirements due to the computationally limited and portable nature of IoT objects. In this paper, an IoT objects authentication framework is proposed. The framework uses device-specific information, called fingerprints, along with a transfer learning tool to authenticate objects in the IoT. The framework tracks the effect of changes in the physical environment on fingerprints and uses unique IoT environmental effects features to detect both cyber and cyber-physical emulation attacks. The proposed environmental effects estimation framework is proven to improve the detection rate of attackers without increasing the false positives rate. The proposed framework is also shown to be able to detect cyber-physical attackers that are capable of replicating the fingerprints of target objects which conventional methods are unable to detect. A transfer learning approach is proposed to allow the use of objects with different types and features in the environmental effects estimation process to enhance the performance of the framework while capturing practical IoT deployments with diverse object types. Simulation results using real IoT device data show that the proposed approach can yield a 40% improvement in cyber emulation attacks detection and is able to detect cyber-physical emulation attacks that conventional methods cannot detect. The results also show that the proposed framework improves the authentication accuracy while the transfer learning approach yields up to 70% additional performance gains.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2910233","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1524634); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8686169","Authentication;Internet of Things (IoT);security;transfer learning","Internet of Things;Emulation;Authentication;Feature extraction;Intelligent sensors","","24","","25","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CPES security evaluation is challenging since the physical and cyber layers are often not considered holistically. Existing literature focuses on only optimizing the operation of either the physical or cyber layer while ignoring the interactions between them. This article proposes a metric, the cyber–physical energy system quantitative security metric (CPES-QSM), that quantifies the interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three domains: 1) electrical; 2) cyber-risk; and 3) network topology. A method for incorporating the proposed cyber-metric into operational decisions is also proposed by formulating a cyber-constrained ac optimal power flow (C-ACOPF) that considers the status of all the CPES layers. The C-ACOPF considers the vulnerabilities of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such as voltage stability, contingencies, graph theory, and IoT cyber risks, while using a multicriteria decision-making technique.

Cybercrime is a common issue in the network world and this opportunity has increased in the IoT base systems. It becomes difficult to investigate due to Internet of Things base systems that have increased complexity as the numerous IoT devices and ecosystems. As there are billions of devices connected to the internet as a result cyber criminals quickly attack the systems over the network. Identifying such crimes is difficult to trace in the IoT base application.

With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Some technologies, including cyber-physical-system (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST) as a broader vision of the IoT was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this paper we develop a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment.

However, providing periodic communication for large-scale CPS is a challenging issue, because the network resources are shared by a large number of nodes. Consequently, it usually happens that, though the sender periodically sends messages, the arrival intervals of messages on the receiver are larger than the period. In this paper, we suggest an adaptation framework for periodic N-to-1 communication over Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), a well-known publish-subscribe (pub-sub) messaging protocol. Our suggested framework monitors the usage of computation and network resources, and adaptively adjusts the publication period in consideration of characteristics of the pub-sub protocol, such as split TCP connections and QoS levels.

One of the main issues is increasing the efficiency of use-limited resources (time, energy, radio frequency spectrum) by the Internet of things devices. Besides, there is a lack of guaranteeing trustworthy, user/data security and resistance against adversaries there. In this regard, trustworthiness evaluation and a coherent recommendation of estimating friend nodes' reliability will allow achieving network security and isolating malicious nodes' environment.

However, larger sampling periods may cause worse control performance. The goal of our work is to develop a robust to early termination optimization approach that can be used to effectively solve onboard optimization problems involved in controlling the system despite the presence of unpredictable, variable, and limited computing capacity. The significance of the developed approach is that the optimization iterations can be stopped at any time instant with a guaranteed feasible solution; as a result, optimization-based control tasks can be implemented with a small sampling period (and consequently with a minimum degradation in the control performance).","","978-1-6654-8201-1","10.1109/CAADCPS56132.2022.00009","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:ECCS-1931738,ECCS-1932530,CMMI-1904394); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9804580","Optimization-Based-Control-Tasks;Cyber-Physical-Systems;Limited-Computing-Capacity","Degradation;Conferences;Process control;Cyber-physical systems;Control systems;Real-time systems;Task analysis","","8","","10","IEEE","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SoS architectural design should facilitate the prediction of the impact of architectural changes and potential failures due to SoS behavior. However, existing approaches do not support such evaluation. Hence, these systems have been usually built without a proper evaluation of their architecture. This article presents Dynamic-SoS, an approach to predict/anticipate at design time the SoS architectural behavior at runtime to evaluate whether the SoS can sustain their operation. The main contributions of this approach comprise: (i) characterization of the dynamic architecture changes via a set of well-defined operators; (ii) a strategy to automatically include a reconfiguration controller for SoS simulation; and (iii) a means to evaluate architectural configurations that an SoS could assume at runtime, assessing their impact on the viability of the SoS operation.

CPS sends messages to physical devices to carry out computational operations. CPS mainly deals with the interplay among cyber and physical environments. The real-time network data acquired and collected in physical space is stored there, and the connection becomes sophisticated. CPS incorporates cyber and physical technologies at all phases. Cyber Physical Systems are a crucial component of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The CPS is a traditional concept that brings together the physical and digital worlds inhabit. Nevertheless, CPS has several difficulties that are likely to jeopardise our lives immediately, while the CPS's numerous levels are all tied to an immediate threat, therefore necessitating a look at CPS security. Due to the inclusion of IoT devices in a wide variety of applications, the security and privacy of users are key considerations. The rising level of cyber threats has left current security and privacy procedures insufficient. As a result, hackers can treat every person on the Internet as a product. Deep Learning (DL) methods are therefore utilised to provide accurate outputs from big complex databases where the outputs generated can be used to forecast and discover vulnerabilities in IoT systems that handles medical data. Cyber-physical systems need anomaly detection to be secure. However, the rising sophistication of CPSs and more complex attacks means that typical anomaly detection approaches are unsuitable for addressing these difficulties since they are simply overwhelmed by the volume of data and the necessity for domain-specific knowledge. The various attacks like DoS, DDoS need to be avoided that impact the network performance. In this paper, an effective Network Cluster Reliability Model with enhanced security and privacy levels for the data in IoT for Anomaly Detection (NSRM-AD) using deep learning model is proposed.

For this purpose, a force sensor is installed in the milling CNC machine center to measure the vibration conditions. Accordingly, an IoT architecture is designed to connect the sensor node and the cloud server to capture the real-time machine’s status via message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol.

Enabling blockchain technology into IoT can help to achieve a proper distributed consensus based IoT system that overcomes those disadvantages. While this is an ideal match, it is still a challenging endeavor. In this paper we take a first step towards that goal by designing Hybrid-IoT, a hybrid blockchain architecture for IoT. In Hybrid-IoT, subgroups of IoT devices form PoW blockchains, referred to as PoW sub-blockchains. Then, the connection among the PoW sub-blockchains employs a BFT inter-connector framework, such as Polkadot or Cosmos.

However, in some specific occasions where wireless communication is used as a means of communication for internal equipment, such as medium-sized UAVs and driverless vehicles, it has many problems in safety, high speed and stability. Moreover, the existing wired communication modes, such as FlexRay RS485 and CAN, are difficult to meet the modern requirements of high-speed real-time communication and remote direct memory access. Unified Model Bus (UM-BUS) is a dynamic reconfigurable high-speed serial bus which is designed to solve these problems in distributed compute and control system in CPS or IoT applications. Based on these elements, this paper proposes a design of encoding arbitration and interrupt request in UM-BUS controller which is used to capture signals of access or other interrupt events. Because of the encoding arbitration and interrupt request method, ""device access interrupt"" process can be added in UM-BUS interrupt controller after a synchronous package was sent by the Master node with time synchronizing function. And thus, it means that when the process is completed, the system has a basic communication condition of low speed, under which the bus system can start a low-precision synchronization, and after the completion of the low-precision synchronization condition, the system has the ability of lane detection. Ultimately, the addition of interrupt simplifies the original design of UM-BUS controller hierarchically and divisionally by the means of the proposed design.","","978-1-7281-2980-8","10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8875335","Dynamic Reconfigurable Bus;Interrupt Request;CPS;IoT","Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Topology;Protocols;Reliability;Cameras;Encoding","","","","10","IEEE","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One example is the applicability of blockchain systems to provide security and privacy of IoT networks, which is the topic of this article. Blockchain systems are on the rise, as crypto-currency payment systems (such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc.) boomed in the last few years due to their attractive de-centralized and anonymous features. As in every transaction, access of the users to IoT systems needs to be controlled. However, these systems are peer-to-peer systems and do not have centralized control, which means that traditional access control techniques will not be optimal. As a result, distributed access control schemes are needed and this paper aims at providing the state of the art in the literature. Thereby, we introduce and discuss the details and applicability of centralized (role-based) and distributed (threshold-signature, reputation, trusted-computing, identity, capability, ACL, group-signature, and hybrid) access control schemes to blockchain systems under the IoT ecosystems. Moreover, permissioned vs. permissionless blockchain systems are also discussed.

This requires an authentic key exchange between two communicating entities, which in turn needs a mutual authentication of the entities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach supplying zero-knowledge and identity-based authentication with integrated key exchange while meeting the IoT challenges. Our approach is resistant to active man in the middle attacks and does not include any costly cryptographic operations. Also, it does not require any predistribution or pre-sharing with regard to authenticating entities. Additionally, our identity-based scheme allows that a thing can operate autonomously in a secure manner. Furthermore, this scheme provides application-independence without requiring additional components and procedures.

This paper presents a methodology to determine utilization of FM radio spectrum, which would support efficient IoT device communication via CR. The methodology is showcased by analyzing the FM radio spectrum in an urban area and determining its capacity to support IoT device communication.

Thus, implementing and analyzing HE schemes and protocols on resource-constrained devices is essential to deriving optimized and secure schemes. This paper develops an energy profiling framework for homomorphic encryption on IoT devices. In particular, we analyze energy consumption and performance such as CPU and Memory utilization and execution time of numerous HE schemes using SEAL and HElib libraries on the Raspberry Pi 4 hardware platform and study energy-performance-security trade-offs. Our analysis reveals that HE schemes can incur a maximum of 70.07% in terms of energy consumption among the libraries. Finally, we provide guidelines for optimization of Homomorphic Encryption by leveraging multi-threading and edge computing capabilities for IoT applications.

However, accompanied with those new opportunities, on the other hand engineering such systems and their architectures has become a complex and difficult task. Having recognized this issue, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been introduced in order to provide viewpoints for structuring an Industry 4.0 based system according to the different concerns to address. Although providing a standardized framework, at the current point of view it is difficult to describe a detailed system architecture, since this reference model is missing formalizations and common methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a possibility of aligning the model-based engineering methods introduced by the Software Platform Embedded Systems (SPES) with the architectural concepts of RAMI 4.0 in order to close the aforementioned gap and provide well-defined methodology in order to develop current and future industrial systems.

To overcome these issues, a new approach is suggested that is based on the Graph Attention Network (GAN), a multi-dimensional algorithm that captures behavioral features along with the relevant information that other methods do not deliver. This approach utilizes masked self-attentional layers to address the limitations of prior Deep Learning (DL) methods that rely on convolutions.

In this context, Italy is searching for a promising solution to safeguard coasts but, at the same time, to manage in an intelligent and “green” way the big amount of tourists. Research communities all over the world indicated the Internet of Things (IoT) as a valid technology to develop solutions in order to try solving or mitigating the coastal erosion problem. IoT-based techniques allow to manage heterogeneous and massive data for real-time monitoring and decision making and can be used for coastal environment and crowd level monitoring. This article presents a monitoring system based on the Social IoT (SIoT), a new paradigm that defines a network where every node is an object capable of establishing the social relationships with other things in an autonomous way according to specific rules. Thanks to social relationships, all involved devices in the monitoring system (i.e., sensors, cameras, and smartphones) are able to collect and exchange information. The proposed system, developed and installed in Cagliari (Italy), is able to evaluate the occupational state of a beach considering environmental and crowding data collected by devices and feedback sent by users.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2954202","Italian Ministry of University and Research, within the Smart Cities Framework(grant numbers:Cagliari2020,PON04a200381,PON04a200490); 2018 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings); IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom); IEEE International Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom); IEEE International Conference on Smart Data (SmartData), Halifax, NS, Canada, 30 July-August 3, 2018; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906096","Cloud platform;crowd detection;eco-tourism;environment monitoring;sensor networks;Social Internet of Things (SIoT)","Sea measurements;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Sensors;Real-time systems;Smart phones;Geophysical measurements;Climate change","","21","","38","IEEE","19 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, with this revolutionary transformation, researchers, implementers, deployers, and users are faced with many challenges. IoT is a complicated, crowded, and complex field; there are various types of devices, protocols, communication channels, architectures, middleware, and more. Standardization efforts are plenty, and this chaos will continue for quite some time. What is clear, on the other hand, is that IoT deployments are increasing with accelerating speed, and this trend will not stop in the near future. As the field grows in numbers and heterogeneity, “intelligence” becomes a focal point in IoT. Since data now becomes “big data,” understanding, learning, and reasoning with big data is paramount for the future success of IoT. One of the major problems in the path to intelligent IoT is understanding “context,” or making sense of the environment, situation, or status using data from sensors, and then acting accordingly in autonomous ways. This is called “context-aware computing,” and it now requires both sensing and, increasingly, learning, as IoT systems get more data and better learning from this big data. In this survey, we review the field, first, from a historical perspective, covering ubiquitous and pervasive computing, ambient intelligence, and wireless sensor networks, and then, move to context-aware computing studies. Finally, we review learning and big data studies related to IoT. We also identify the open issues and provide an insight for future study areas for IoT researchers.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2773600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8110603","Big data in Internet of Things (IoT);context awareness;data management and analytics;machine learning in IoT","Big Data;Context-aware services;Wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;Data mining;Protocols;Standards","","307","1","218","IEEE","15 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to IoT devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like IoT applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term IoT device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat. This article provides a survey on what can be called post-quantum IoT systems (IoT systems protected from the currently known quantum computing attacks): the main post-quantum cryptosystems and initiatives are reviewed, the most relevant IoT architectures and challenges are analyzed, and the expected future trends are indicated.

The explosive growth of mobile users and IoT applications injects massive traffic to the IoT network and also speeds up the drainage of sensor batteries. Caching at the IoT gateway (GW), which stores the IoT data and directly send them to the users, can avoid activating sensors too frequently, hence reducing the traffic in the IoT network as well as the energy consumption of sensors. To overcome the limited energy capacity of sensors, energy transmitters (ETs) are deployed to charge them. Practically, the GW and ETs may be owned by different operators, and the GW operator needs to incentivize ETs to provision the charging service. In this paper, we formulate a Stackelberg game in the cache-enabled energy harvesting aided IoT framework to improve the user quality of service. Caching strategies, incentive strategies, and ET transmission power strategies are jointly optimized to find the Stackelberg equilibrium by our proposed alternative direction approach.

In such a connected environment, the social IoT (SIoT) has become an emerging trend where multiple IoT devices owned by users support communication within a social circle. Trust management in the SIoT network is imperative as trusting the information from compromised devices could lead to serious compromises within the network. It is important to have a mechanism where the devices and their users evaluate the trustworthiness of other devices and users before trusting the information sent by them. The privacy preservation, decentralization, and self-enforcing management without involving trusted third parties are the fundamental challenges in designing a trust management system for SIoT. To fulfill these challenges, this article presents a novel framework for computing and updating the trustworthiness of participants in the SIoT network in a self-enforcing manner without relying on any trusted third party. The privacy of the participants in the SIoT is protected by using homomorphic encryption in the decentralized setting. To achieve the properties of self-enforcement, the trust score of each device is automatically updated based on its previous trust score and the up-to-date tally of the votes by its peers in the network with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enforce that every participant follows the protocol honestly. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and present evaluation benchmarks by prototyping the main functionality of the system. The performance results show that the system has a linear increase in computation and communication overheads with more participants in the network. Furthermore, we prove the correctness, privacy, and security of the proposed system under a malicious adversarial model.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2962282","European Research Council (ERC)(grant numbers:306994); Royal Society(grant numbers:ICA/R1/180226); ERC Proof of Concept(grant numbers:677124); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949450","Privacy-preserving aggregation;secure multiparty computation (SMC);self-enforcing trust aggregation;social Internet of Things (SIoT)","Privacy;Trust management;Internet of Things;Protocols;Data privacy;Cryptography","","62","","70","IEEE","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It extends connectivity to everyday things, however, such increase in the connectivity creates many prominent challenges. Context: Generally, IoT opens the door for new applications for machine-to-machine and human-to-human communications. The current trend of collaborating, distributed teams through the Internet, mobile communications, and autonomous entities, e.g., robots, is the first phase of the IoT to develop and deliver diverse services and applications. However, such collaborations is threatened by the fragmentation that we witness in the industry nowadays as it brings difficulty to integrate the diverse technologies of the various objects found in IoT systems. Diverse technologies induce interoperability issues while designing and developing various services and applications, hence, limiting the possibility of reusing the data, more specifically, the software (including frameworks, firmware, applications programming interfaces, and user interfaces) as well as of facing issues, like security threats and bugs, when developing new services or applications. Different aspects of handling data collection ranging from discovering smart sensors for data collection, integrating and applying reasoning on them must be available to provide interoperability and flexibility to the diverse objects interacting in the system. However, such approaches are bound to be challenged in future IoT scenarios as they bring substantial performance impairments in settings with the very large number of collaborating devices and technologies. Objective: We raise the awareness of the community about the lack of interoperability among technologies developed for IoT and challenges that their integration poses. We also provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners interested in connecting IoT networks and devices to develop services and applications. Method: We apply the methods advocated by the evidence-based software engineering paradigm. This paradigm and its core tool, the systematic literature review (SLR), were introduced to the software-engineering research community early 2004 to help researchers and industry systematically and objectively gather and aggregate evidences about different topics. In this paper, we conduct an SLR of both IoT interoperability issues and the state-of-practice of IoT technologies in the industry, highlighting the integration challenges related to the IoT that have significantly shifted the landscape of Internet-based collaborative services and applications nowadays. Results: Our SLR identifies a number of studies from journals, conferences, and workshops with the highest quality in the field.

Many architectural limitations, such as weak security, data distribution efficiency, provenance and traceability of sources, excessive human intervention, lack of interoperability, and service-awareness in devices configuration, have been exposed and called the society attention. This paper addresses these limitations by properly integrating five strategies: 1) efficient IoT data exchanging, storage and processing via information-centric networking (ICN); 2) contract-based IoT services composition; 3) software-control/management of IoT devices accordingly to the services requirements; 4) naming and name resolution of the physical and virtual entities, proving identifier/locator splitting and contextualized self-organization; and 5) name-based routing and network caching. Considering the current state-of-the art, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: proposal of a novel service-defined architecture (SDA), in which device configurations are a reflex of the real service needs (given by established contracts); combination of ICN benefits with named-services; and perennial identification of IoT devices, services, and data using self-verifiable naming. All integration work has been supported by a convergent architecture called NovaGenesis (NG), demonstrating its viability as an alternative for the current IoT architectures. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented in laboratory under real conditions. The experimental results indicate competitive performance in terms of data transfer, memory and CPU consumption.

In this article, our contributions are: 1) a survey that sheds light on various techniques (the state of the art) used for reducing the power consumption based on monitoring the occupant's behavior; 2) a comparison between these techniques based on various factors elicited from the literature review; and 3) this study reveals the following gaps in the previous work: a) lack of integrity between the IoT systems; b) lack of auto measuring of the user satisfaction; and c) lack of achieving a balance between the user satisfaction and the power saving. As an attempt to close the above gaps, this article proposes a smart and integrated IoT framework for automeasuring of the user satisfaction and thus, achieves a balance between the power conservation and the user satisfaction. Besides, it suggests future research directions for researchers.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3051764","Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9326414","Internet of Things;power conservation;smart framework;user satisfaction","Internet of Things;Buildings;Sensors;Power demand;Monitoring;Hardware;Energy consumption","","13","","91","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the growing multiple tasks from users are occuring with the emergence of the IoT environment. Meanwhile, the current computation offloading with QoE is solved by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the issue of instability and slow convergence. Therefore, improving the QoE in edge-enabled IoT is still the ultimate challenge. In this article, to enhance the QoE, we propose a new QoE model to study the computation offloading. Specifically, the emerged QoE model can capture three influential elements: 1) service latency determined by local computing latency and transmission latency; 2) energy consumption according to local calculation and transmission consumption; and 3) task success rate based on the coding error probability. Moreover, we improve the deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) algorithm and propose a algorithm named the double-dueling-deterministic policy gradients (D3PG) based on the proposed model. Specifically, the actor network highly relies on the critic network, which makes the performance of the DDPG sensitive to the critic and thus leads to poor stability and slow convergence in the computation offloading process. To solve this, we redesign the critic network by using Double Q -learning and Dueling networks. Extensive experiments verify the better stability and faster convergence of our proposed algorithm than existing methods. In addition, experiments also indicate that our proposed algorithm can improve the QoE performance.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2981557","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872195,61772286); “333” Project of Jiangsu Province, China(grant numbers:BRA2017401); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9039641","Computation offloading;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);edge;Internet of Things (IoT);Quality of Experience (QoE)","Quality of experience;Task analysis;Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Servers;Convergence;Energy consumption","","135","","40","IEEE","17 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The IoT devices are becoming increasingly complex. With the rapid deployment of cameras, tasks in IoT like visual information are more important, but IoT devices have limited computing resources, including power, computing ability, storage, etc. Some tasks that might be perfectly normal to perform on a computer would be rather challenging on an IoT device. Therefore, how to maintain acceptable performance while minimizing resources is becoming a more consequential part in IoT. In this article, we aim to solve the problem of object detection and tracking in IoT while minimizing resources. The traditional algorithms need to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify different objects in each frame, and then determine the tracking target from identified objects, which typically requires a lot of computing resources. By incorporating spatial attention, and multidomain network, we proposed a novel algorithm named as spatial attention powered multidomain network (SA-MDNet). By adding the spatial attention mechanism to the original MDNet model, and using multiclass cross-entropy loss, we are able to distinguish the background and the target in different video sequences effectively and efficiently. This novel algorithm achieves similar performance on the OTB 50/100/2013 data sets compared to several state-of-art models, while uses only a fraction of the memory compared to MDNet.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3099855","Science and Technology Planning Project in Henan Province(grant numbers:212102210326); Key Research Projects of Henan Higher Schools(grant numbers:21B460007); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51975428,51975426); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9495931","Internet of Things (IoT);multidomain network;object detection;object tracking;spatial attention","Target tracking;Internet of Things;Task analysis;Convolution;Target recognition;Visualization;Learning systems","","11","","29","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Concerning the heterogeneous and unknown traffic flows in IoT, iAcceSD uses machine learning (ML)-based traffic identification mechanisms at the access node. The SD-Controller trains a lightweight ML module for a specific SD-Access node dealing with a similar set of traffic flows. By processing flows at the edge, network latency is reduced in the proposed scheme.

In the IoT, the collaborating entities encompass both physical and virtual resources, interactions occur both in an active and programmed way as well as by chance, and therefore it is necessary to deal with expected but also emerging behaviors of the collaborating parties. In this paper, we first discuss the main features that make IoT a unique ecosystem, and as such, calls for new software development solutions. We claim that there is a need to rethinking the techniques and methodologies for developing IoT systems and applications. Novel models, architectural approaches and techniques should be proposed, or existing ones should be adapted to deal with the high heterogeneity, dynamism, serendipity and interdependencies that are typical of the IoT ecosystem. We then analyze and discuss potential key design solutions that deserve a deeper understanding in order to pave the way for the building of this new generation of systems.

Secondly, achieving effective exploitation of computer resources is difficult, due to operational constraints resulting from current paradigms and uncomprehensive software infrastructures which hinder flexibility, adaptation, and smooth coordination of computational tasks execution. Indeed, building dynamic, context-oriented applications in small-or large-scale IoT with traditional abstractions is hard: even harder is to achieve opportunistic, QoS-and QoE-driven application task management across available hardware and networking infrastructure. In this insight paper, we analyse by the collective adaptation perspective the key directions of the impelling paradigm shift urged by forthcoming large-scale IoT scenarios.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multi-layer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ""edge router"" incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.","","978-1-5386-7244-0","10.1109/ICIOT.2018.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8473435","6LoWPAN;AWS IOT;Internet of Things","Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Hardware;Cryptography;Open source software;Real-time systems","","2","","19","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, trustworthy data act as fuel for applications that rely on the data generated by these things, for critical decision-making processes, data debugging, risk assessment, forensic analysis, and performance tuning. Currently, secure and reliable data communication in IoT is based on public-key cryptosystems such as the elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC). Nevertheless, the reliance on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by the impending quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical primitives to quantum-safe primitives is indispensable to ensure the overall security of data en route. In this article, we investigate applications of one of the postquantum signatures called hash-based signature (HBS) schemes for the security of IoT devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the evolution of HBS schemes with an emphasis on their construction parameters and associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline the striking features of HBS schemes and their significance for IoT security in the quantum era. We also investigate the optimal selection of HBS in the IoT networks with respect to their performance-constrained requirements, resource-constrained nature, and design optimization objectives.

Accordingly, the application of IoT and CPS has been expanded in applied electrical systems and machines. However, cybersecurity represents the main challenge of the implementation of IoT against cyber-attacks. In this regard, this paper proposes a new IoT architecture based on utilizing machine learning techniques to suppress cyber-attacks for providing reliable and secure online monitoring for the induction motor status. In particular, advanced machine learning techniques are utilized here to detect cyber-attacks and motor status with high accuracy. The proposed infrastructure validates the motor status via communication channels and the internet connection with economical cost and less effort on connecting various networks. For this purpose, the CONTACT Element platform for IoT is adopted to visualize the processed data based on machine learning techniques through a graphical dashboard. Once the cyber-attacks signal has been detected, the proposed IoT platform based on machine learning will be visualized automatically as fake data on the dashboard of the IoT platform. Different experimental scenarios with data acquisition are carried out to emphasize the performance of the suggested IoT topology. The results confirm that the proposed IoT architecture based on the machine learning technique can effectively visualize all faults of the motor status as well as the cyber-attacks on the networks. Moreover, all faults of the motor status and the fake data, due to the cyber-attacks, are successfully recognized and visualized on the dashboard of the proposed IoT platform with high accuracy and more clarified visualization, thereby contributing to enhancing the decision-making about the motor status. Furthermore, the introduced IoT architecture with Random Forest algorithm provides an effective detection for the faults on motor due to the vibration under industrial conditions with excellent accuracy of 99.03% that is significantly greater than the other machine learning algorithms.

All the single-antenna IoT devices in each cluster cooperate with each other to establish a virtual MIMO entity, and multiple independent data streams are requested by each cluster. NOMA is employed to superimpose all the requested data streams, and each cluster leverages zero-forcing detection to demultiplex the input data streams. Only statistical channel state information (CSI) is available at the base station to avoid the waste of the energy and bandwidth on frequent CSI estimations. The outage probability and goodput of the virtual MIMO-NOMA system are thoroughly investigated by considering the Kronecker model, which embraces both the transmit and receive correlations. Furthermore, the asymptotic results facilitate not only the exploration of physical insights but also the goodput maximization. In particular, the asymptotic outage expressions provide quantitative impacts of various system parameters and enable the investigation of diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). Moreover, power allocation coefficients and/or transmission rates can be properly chosen to achieve the maximal goodput. By favor of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, the goodput maximization problems can be solved in closed form, with which the joint power and rate selection is realized by using alternately iterating optimization. Besides, the optimization algorithms tend to allocate more power to clusters under unfavorable channel conditions and support clusters with a higher transmission rate under benign channel conditions.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2957209","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFE0120600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801192,61801246,61601524); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019A1515012136); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114002,2019B010137006); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau, China(grant numbers:0036/2019/A1,037/2017/AMJ,SKL-IOTSC2018-2020); Open Research Foundation of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory of Southeast University(grant numbers:2018D09); Research Committee of University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00156-FST,MYRG2016-00171-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920088","Internet of Things (IoT);Kronecker model;nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA);virtual multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);zero forcing (ZF)","NOMA;MIMO communication;Internet of Things;Power system reliability;Probability;Correlation;Downlink","","34","","75","IEEE","3 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonetheless, the communication on public channel among different IIoT entities in an SDN-enabled environment may be exposed to various security threats due to wireless and insecure communication channels. To counter these security challenges in the way of wider CPS or IIoT adoption, we propose a novel three-factor authenticated key exchange mechanism (SUSIC) for SDN-enabled IIoT ecosystem.

IoT refers to a new paradigm of the Internet in which various objects (or things), that were not traditionally part of the conventional Internet, attain the ability of being effective parts of communications networks. These things can actively collect, analyze, and exchange data with other things or systems connected to the Internet. Furthermore, these things can take useful actions through activating actuators that are attached to them (or at least situated close by). As IoT systems become popular in various domains and applications today, we can see rich resources on these systems available in the literature. Such literature motivates the efforts to develop courses on IoT for students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. However, a major challenge occurs in approaching a course that is supposed to compile topics tackling various, and diverse, technologies in a unified material for university students. In this paper, we draw on the experiences gained from teaching the Introduction to the Internet of Things course for three consecutive semesters at the American University of Kuwait. We aim at sharing the lessons learnt out of this experience with the teaching and research community. A main target of this work is to develop helpful guidelines on how to introduce undergraduate students to the emerging technologies of IoT.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-9506-7","10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725186","Internet of Things Course;Communication Protocols;Hardware Design;Software Design;Internet of Things System;Internet of Things Device;Web Development;Cloud Computing","Internet of Things;Protocols;Education;Hardware;Computer languages;Software","","12","","7","IEEE","30 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This represents a research challenge that we aim to address in this paper. We systematically analysed recent literature to identify privacy threats in FL within IoT environments, and evaluate the defensive measures that can be employed to mitigate these threats. Using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach, we searched five publication databases (Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Wiley, ACM, and Science Direct), collating relevant papers published between 2017 and April 2024, a period which spans from the introduction of FL until now. Guided by the PRISMA protocol, we selected 49 papers to focus our systematic review on. We analysed these papers, paying special attention to the privacy threats and defensive measures – specifically within the context of IoT – using inclusion and exclusion criteria tailored to highlight recent advances and critical insights. We identified various privacy threats, including inference attacks, poisoning attacks, and eavesdropping, along with defensive measures such as Differential Privacy and Secure Multi-Party Computation. These defences were evaluated for their effectiveness in protecting privacy without compromising the functional integrity of FL in IoT settings. Our review underscores the necessity for robust and efficient privacy-preserving strategies tailored for IoT environments. Notably, there is a need for strategies against replay, evasion, and model stealing attacks. Exploring lightweight defensive measures and emerging technologies such as blockchain may help improve the privacy of FL in IoT, leading to the creation of FL models that can operate under variable network conditions.","2836-3701","979-8-3503-5163-7","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData-Cybermatics62450.2024.00072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10731741","Federated Learning;Internet of Things;Privacy Threats;Defensive Measures;Systematic Literature Review","Privacy;Differential privacy;Social computing;Computational modeling;Multi-party computation;Robustness;Blockchains;Internet of Things;Time factors;Security","","","","70","IEEE","31 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This trend brings great opportunities for manufacturing companies, but also inherits challenges to overcome. Resulting from this, a heterogeneous tool-landscape has emerged, where each of the single tools is addressing a particular aspect of the value-creation network. An example for such a tool specifically targeting the engineering of such flexible production systems according to the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been proposed with the RAMI Toolbox. However, as universal frameworks are too general to deal with all aspects of developing such complex systems, other possibilities for conflictfree engineering of the system need to be available. Thus, the main contribution of this paper deals with proposing a Round-trip Engineering (RTE) approach, that allows to export previously modeled flexible production systems according to the peculiarities of RAMI 4.0 and subsequently reload external elaborated results. Thereby, a major benefit is the application of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), which ensures the traceability to the remaining system components. The chosen methodology for bidirectionally exchanging the engineering data is AutomationML, which allows to store exported information from RAMI 4.0 or import such stored information into it. The RTE-approach is thereby evaluated with a real-world case study, the Siemens Fischertechnik industrial plant model.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921425","Siemens; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921425","Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0);Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE);Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);AutomationML;Round-trip Engineering (RTE)","Industries;Production systems;Three-dimensional printing;Market research;Manufacturing;Industrial plants;Internet of Things","","1","","23","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the presence of physical systems in the continuous-time domain and computational models in the discrete-time domain, end-to-end verification of these systems is highly challenging. Existing formal methods focus on verifying physical models assuming static or simplified computation models. In contrast, existing real-time systems focus on satisfying strict timing bounds but do not care how those bounds are obtained and how they relate to physical safety. Our approach bridges these two domains, and constitutes an end-to-end verification framework for arbitrary physical models and computational models incorporated within a cyber-physical automated system. By allowing the interaction between the computational and physical models, our verification framework enables a fine-grained scheme that verifies against the local environment instead of verifying against global worst-case assumptions. Moreover, to support locally varying worst-case scenarios, a mixed-criticality system is proposed where the system supports several critical models and switches among the modes based on environmental uncertainty.

In this article, we consider a multiuser single-destination Internet of Things (IoT) system with periodic state updating, and investigate the scheduling methods of minimizing the long-term average AoI with limited retransmission times. In view of the retransmission mode, the AoI optimization problems for retransmission with and without feedback are analyzed. For the retransmission without feedback, we formulate the expected decision loss (EDL) function of the AoI optimization problem with the finite retransmission times and propose a loss-greedy policy by minimizing the EDL at each step. For the retransmission with feedback, a potential optimal solution is to construct the AoI optimization problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and solve the corresponding Bellman optimal equations. However, this optimal solution is prone to suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is hard to implement. To address this issue, we decouple the infinite-horizon MDP into the finite-state MDP in each single frame, and then propose a low-complexity slot-based max-weight (SBMW) policy to minimize the long-term average AoI. Numerical results show that, compared with an ALOHA-like baseline policy, the proposed Loss-Greedy policy can achieve up to 48% reduction of the average AoI for the retransmission without feedback, while the SBMW policy can reduce the average AoI by 57% in the retransmission with feedback. The average performance gain of the proposed policies over the state-of-the-art policies is at least 10%.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3181260","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972061); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyjjqX0012); Fundamental Research and Frontier Exploration Program of Chongqing, China(grant numbers:cstc2021ycjh-bgzxm0017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9790825","Age of Information (AoI);Internet of Things (IoT);retransmission;scheduling","Internet of Things;Optimal scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Time measurement;Data integrity;Automatic repeat request;Wireless communication","","7","","26","IEEE","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The number of services at the edge of IoT is rising rapidly due to the prevalent uses of smart devices and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). To explore the promising applications of IoT services, one of the challenges is to enable the interoperability of the services in a decentralized environment. The blockchain technology (BCT) has been proven as a promising solution to establish the trust of data and call for executions; theoretically, it can be used to support the interoperability of services. BCT verifies data or a process and stores it as a transaction in a distributed ledger. Similar to the topology to IoT, applying BCT at the edges of the network exhibits the distributed characteristic. However, currently, BCT is still facing the challenges for interoperability due to a number of factors such as consensus protocols, block sizes, and interval of blocks. Prominent protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW) may cause excessive delays in finality settlement. One promising protocol Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant offers a fast finality settlement and uses hyperledger to support the scalability; however, the trust might also be a concern if the validators are chosen improperly. This paper discusses the interoperability of IoT services and the challenges and proposes an architecture solution by integrating BCT, service-oriented architecture (SoA), and enablers of key performance indicators (KPIs) and service selections. The proposed architecture aims to solve both interoperability and trust issues for IoT services.

Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly reduces the signaling overhead while maintaining competitive authentication performance by taking advantage of both physical layer authentication and cryptography-based authentication.","","978-1-7281-9972-6","10.1109/ICSPCS50536.2020.9310058","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9310058","Authentication and Key Agreement;Internet of Things;Physical Layer Authentication","Authentication;Protocols;Physical layer;Cryptography;Programmable logic arrays;5G mobile communication;Channel estimation","","3","","21","IEEE","4 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing ICPS paradigms for IoT applications must be rectified due to security, failure, execution, and communication delays. This study proposes an optimal, delay-efficient ICPS paradigm for IoT applications. The research considers task offloading and scheduling problems and presents the evolutionary meta-heuristics offloading scheduling (EMOS) algorithm framework. The EMOS algorithm framework comprises several delay-optimal schemes to address the offloading and scheduling challenges of IoT applications. The primary objective is to execute IoT applications on different nodes while adhering to the specified constraints.

In such a context, Runtime Verification has emerged as a promising solution that combines the formal specification of properties to be validated and monitors that perform these validations during runtime. Although helpful, runtime verification solutions introduce an inevitable overhead in the system, which can disrupt its correct functioning if not safely employed. We propose the creation of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that, given a generic CPS, 1) verifies if its real- time scheduling is guaranteed, even in the presence of coupled monitors, and 2) implements several verification conditions for the correct-by-construction generation of monitoring architectures.

These digital devices, however, are susceptible to cyber and physical attacks, that may alter their functionality, and therefore the integrity of their measurements/actions. In practice, industrial control systems utilize simple control laws, which rely on various sensor measurements and algorithms which are expected to operate normally. To reduce the impact of a potential failure, operators may deploy redundant components; this however may not be useful, e.g., when a cyber attack at a PLC component occurs. In this work, we address the problem of reducing vulnerability to cyber-physical attacks in water distribution networks. This is achieved by augmenting the graph which describes the information flow from sensors to actuators, by adding new connections and algorithms, to increase the number of redundant cyber components. These, in turn, increase the \textit{cyber-physical security level}, which is defined in the present paper as the number of malicious attacks a CPS may sustain before becoming unable to satisfy the control requirements. A proof-of-concept of the approach is demonstrated over a simple WDN, with intuition on how this can be used to increase the cyber-physical security level of the system.","","978-1-5386-6744-6","10.1109/CySWater.2018.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8434713","cyber physical systems;security;water distribution","Security;Sensors;Actuators;Water resources;Cyber-physical systems;Redundancy;Monitoring","","19","","8","IEEE","16 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To deal with this problem, a self-adaptive collaborative control (SCC) mode is proposed for smart production-logistics systems to enhance the capability of intelligence, flexibility, and resilience. By leveraging cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), real-time status data are collected and processed to perform decision making and optimization. Hybrid automata is used to model the dynamic behavior of physical manufacturing resources, such as machines and vehicles in shop floors. Three levels of collaborative control granularity, including nodal SCC, local SCC, and global SCC, are introduced to address different degrees of exceptions. Collaborative optimization problems are solved using analytical target cascading (ATC). A proof of concept simulation based on a Chinese aero-engine manufacturer validates the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method, showing reductions in waiting time, makespan, and energy consumption with reasonable computational time.

Before the establishment of such a system, it should be considered to what extent the users are ready to adopt and use it in their daily routines. Therefore, this paper explores users' attitudes towards using IoT technologies to receive healthcare services. This is in contrast to most previous research, which has studied the technical requirements or devices of the IoT that are required in healthcare services, or ways in which connectivity and performance can be improved using the IoT. Based on known models of technology acceptance, an integrated framework was developed to investigate the impact of security and privacy concerns, and familiarity with the technology, on users' trust in the IoT, and then to measure the effect of that trust on Omani users' attitudes regarding use of IoT technologies to receive healthcare services. This framework enabled the measurement of risk perception as a mediator between user trust and their attitudes towards using the IoT. Data were collected from 387 respondents and were analysed using SPSS 25 and AMOS 25 statistics software. Exploratory and confirmatory analysis and structural equation modelling were applied. The findings showed that levels of security, privacy and familiarity affected trust in the IoT. Furthermore, these levels of trust in the IoT were found to affect both users' perceptions of risk in, and their attitude towards, using the IoT. The users' risk perception partially mediated the relations between users' trust and their attitude regarding use of the IoT. The framework was supported and interpreted by 40 per cent of the variance in the attitude towards using the IoT in healthcare, while the mediator showed 47 per cent of the variance in the attitude towards using the IoT in healthcare.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2904006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663271","Security;privacy;familiarity;trust;riskperception;healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT)","Medical services;Internet of Things;Security;Privacy;Biomedical monitoring;Sensors;Monitoring","","82","","83","OAPA","8 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The incorporation of embedded Internet of Things (IoT) devices makes it tedious to identify vulnerability and difficult to control the service-interruptions and manage the operations losses. Rule-based mechanisms have been considered as a solution in the past. However, rule-based solutions operate on the goodwill of the generated rules and perform assumption-based detection. Such a solution often is far from the actual realization of the IoT runtime performance and can be fooled by zero-day attacks. Thus, this paper takes this issue as motivation and proposes better lightweight behavior rule specification-based misbehavior detection for the IoT-embedded cyber-physical systems (BRIoT). The key concept of our approach is to model a system with which misbehavior of an IoT device manifested as a result of attacks exploiting the vulnerability exposed may be detected through automatic model checking and formal verification, regardless of whether the attack is known or unknown. Automatic model checking and formal verification are achieved through a 2-layer Fuzzy-based hierarchical context-aware aspect-oriented Petri net (HCAPN) model, while effective misbehavior detection to avoid false alarms is achieved through a Barycentric-coordinated-based center of mass calculation method. The proposed approach is verified by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) embedded in a UAV system. The feasibility of the proposed model is demonstrated with high reliability, low operational cost, low false-positives, low false-negatives, and high true positives in comparison with existing rule-based solutions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2917135","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; Korean Government (MSIT) (Rule Specification-Based Misbehavior Detection for IoT-Embedded Cyber-Physical Systems)(grant numbers:2017-0-00664); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA2386-17-1-4076); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8715740","Behavior rules;cyber-physical systems;IoT;specification-based intrusion detection;zero-day attacks","Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Cyber-physical systems;Performance evaluation;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Solid modeling","","58","","42","OAPA","15 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The target CPS consists of a physical plant with unstable linear dynamics and a feedback controller. Specifically, the attack mechanism is to impede the stabilizing function of the feedback controller by injecting false data to the sensors, where the false data are created using the unstable dynamics of the plant. When the only nominal model for the target dynamics is known, the stealthiness is maintained by deploying a mechanism similar to a disturbance observer (DOB) which can be designed to absorb the effect of the mismatch between the nominal and actual dynamics until the attack succeeds. The success of the attack is defined by the norm of the system state exceeding a threshold. Sensor attacks that exploit unstable plant dynamics had been conceived previously. Generation of such attacks require precise knowledge of the target system for stealthiness, i.e., the attack must cancel at the sensor exactly the effect of instability in order to avoid detection. When not exact, the mismatch grows exponentially leading to the detection of abnormality. The attack presented in this paper absorbs the mismatch using the DOB mechanism, where the degree of absorption is selected such that the detection is delayed until the attack succeeds. Thus, the proposed attack, compared to the conventional ones, poses a greater level of threat to CPS. In this paper, generation of the attack is presented, and the effect is analyzed. The consequence of the attack is illustrated and emphasized by simulations on quadrotors and inverted pendulums, respectively.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2905878","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:2014-0-00065); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2013K1A1A2A02078326); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(grant numbers:18-ST-02,18-EE-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669856","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs);model uncertainty;stealthy sensor attack","Actuators;Detectors;Internet of Things;Disturbance observers;Uncertainty;Vehicle dynamics;Adaptive control","","27","","30","IEEE","19 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose an architecture that can take advantage of blockchain features to allow further integrity verification of data produced by IoT devices even in the realm of CPS. Our architecture is divided into three levels, each of them responsible for tasks compatible with their resources capabilities.

Upper levels are responsible for data persistence and integrity verification in the Cloud.

In general, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things are the sensing and communication infrastructures for CPS. Currently, software-defined networking (SDN) have been used as the new networking architecture for typical WSNs and CPS. However, there are two unresolved problems for a software-defined CPS. First, a feasible systemic architecture is a must for software-defined CPS, which should provide a global virtualization management and closed-loop control between the cyber side and the physical side in a CPS. Second, the lifetime of a software-defined CPS scenario needs to be extended for critical applications. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a systematic virtual networking architecture to perform the global virtualization control and monitoring of a CPS, in which network functions virtualization (NFV) configuration and orchestration can be realized. Moreover, based on the proposed architecture, a novel lifetime extension scheme (NLES), is proposed for a software-defined CPS. To orchestrate the resource dynamically and efficiently, the instant programmability of an SDN and instant deployment capability of NFV are utilized to control the topology of node modes of a CPS. Then, a game theoretic topology decision approach is proposed to control the topology of the clustering and virtual network function deployment of sensors at run-time in a CPS. The experimental results show that NLES has longer lifetime compared to those of the traditional schemes.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2870294","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61431008,61831007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8464258","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs);game theory;lifetime extension;network function virtualization (NFV);software-defined networking (SDN)","Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Network function virtualization;Topology;Energy efficiency;Internet of Things","","56","","49","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The cyber-physical conceptualization dramatically reduces the integration effort by virtually eliminating the need, time, and cost for reprogramming. However, there are still important challenges that need to be addressed before one can start to design cyber-physical production systems consistently. These intertwine and are not as easily solvable as the popular science descriptions may suggest. This paper brings them forward and develops a critical comparative analysis between today's automation solutions and their potential cyber-physical counterparts. The analysis considers the technical and conceptual challenges that are included in the process of migrating today's, mostly bespoke, automation solutions to highly modularized, dynamic, and interactive cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs).

When deploying to industrial systems, an important consideration of the ZTA is the effective modeling of the cross-layer penetration between cyber and physical layers. An ineffective model of cross-layer penetration can lead to inferior performance in mitigating cross-layer failures. To tackle this issue, this paper develops a subset of the ZTA dedicated to industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS), called the Cyber-Physical-ZTA, to model cross-layer penetration. Its uniqueness mainly consists of two innovative techniques, namely, a multi-layer access control engine and an integrated physical model-based and data-driven policy optimizer. The multi-layer access control engine can evaluate the trust scores for each component considering their cross-layer impact, while the integration of data-driven and model-based approaches can improve efficiency in optimizing access policies. Our simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of Cyber-Physical-ZTA. In comparison to the standard ZTA, with no rules added to detect cross-layer penetration, the multi-access policy engine of the Cyber-Physical-ZTA increases the detection probability against false data injection (FDI) attacks by more than 31%.","2832-7004","","10.1109/TICPS.2023.3333850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10330693","Cyber-Physical system security;cyber-physical zero trust architecture;industrial cyber-physical system;zero trust architecture","Security;Cross layer design;Cyber-physical systems;Access control;Zero Trust","","4","","37","IEEE","28 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While leveraging the large-scale IoT-based applications like Smart Gird or Smart Cities, IoT also incurs more concerns on privacy and security. Among the top security challenges that IoT face, access authorization is critical in resource sharing and information protection. One of the weaknesses of today's access control (AC) is the centralized authorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. In this paper, BlendCAC, a blockchain-enabled decentralized capability-based AC is proposed for the security of IoTs. The BlendCAC aims at an effective access control processes to devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. Based on the blockchain network, a capability delegation mechanism is suggested for access permission propagation. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of a smart contract for registration, propagation and revocation of the access authorization. In the proposed BlendCAC scheme, IoT devices are their own master to control their resources instead of being supervised by a centralized authority. Implemented and tested on a Raspberry Pi device and on a local private blockchain network, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed BlendCAC approach to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained AC solution to IoT systems.","","978-1-5386-7975-3","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8726680","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Decentralized Access Control (DAC);Internet of Things (IoTs)","Blockchain;Authorization;Internet of Things;Smart contracts;Smart devices","","121","1","37","IEEE","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, research has been directed towards making powerline communication (PLC) feasible as a last mile communication network for IoT, smart grid (SG) and CPS. This paper present results of using a low-cost PLC modem (Texas Instrument's TMS320C2000 C28x) and embedded C programming language as an AWG to generate test signals for PLC, SG, IoT and CPS research purposes. Our implementation is the first known application of the TMS320C2000 C28x as an AWG. Using embedded C language makes the waveforms generated platform independent, and thus, avoids the use of platform dependent hexadecimal assembly languages. This method also overcomes the rigid amplitude problem of the Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) technique. The core embedded signal processor used in this paper is the low-cost TMS320C2000 C28x which is widely deployed in many IoT, CPS, industrial systems and communication networks devices worldwide. It has 16-bit resolution at 100 kHz bandwidth. Several examples of industrial grade arbitrary waveforms were constructed for the TMS320C2000 C28x with the embedded C programming technique. Hence arbitrary signals generated using the C28x will be useful in testing many state of the art and legacy communication, IoT, SG, and CPS networks and devices worldwide. In addition to signal generation, examples are shown of using the arbitrary waveforms generated with TMS320C2000 to implement amplitude modulation (AM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) schemes for CPS, IoT and PLC communication networks.","","978-1-5386-7936-4","10.1109/ICAIT.2018.8686615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8686615","digital signal processing;arbitrary waveform generation;Internet of Things;powerline communication;embedded computing;smart grid","","","1","","31","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, State Grid has deployed the Huawei IoT management platform to realize the standardized collection of data. However, the current IOTs management platform only realizes the access of MQTT protocol, and lacks the unified management capability for multi-source heterogeneous terminals. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel architecture design of power IoTs architecture. Focusing on the southbound device access and northbound device management of the IoTs management platform, a protocol analysis cloud gateway and a unified cloud edge collaboration architecture are proposed. In order to solve the problem of multi-protocol access, the protocol analysis cloud gateway deploys the parsing program in the form of plug-in in the protocol plug-in layer, which can be flexibly extended for new protocols. Aiming at the problem of device management, this paper proposes a unified cloud edge collaboration architecture, enhances the capabilities of remote management for application and container based on the northbound API interface of Huawei IoTs management platform, and proposes a method compatible with different edge computing frameworks on the edge side. At the same time, an experimental prototype system is built to realize the unified access to Q/GDW 1376, DL/T 698, IEC 101/104 and other types of protocol equipment, as well as the remote management of heterogeneous manufacturers' equipment.","","979-8-3503-4715-9","10.1109/EI256261.2022.10117281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10117281","power IoT;cloud-edge collaboration;Edge IOT agent","Cloud computing;Protocols;Collaboration;Prototypes;Computer architecture;System integration;Logic gates","","1","","10","IEEE","10 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research presents an integrated edge computing framework that aims at enhancing security by improving network traffic anomaly detection. It is done based on three advanced anomaly detection algorithms, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA), isolation forest, and autoencoder. PCA is applied to the data to bring it in a compressed form where one is able to detect the outliers by having the most important features of the data extracted. The isolation forest algorithm, which was applied with the contamination factor of 0, is depicted below: 1, is used for the detection of the anomalies in the traffic, and, in fact, it was able to categorize several threats. However, the autoencoder model relies on reconstruction loss to decide if something is wrong with the data, with the 95th percentile as the standard for identifying activities that are odd. Edge computing increases the effectiveness of a framework for real-time anomaly detection and mitigation.

Therefore, in this article, we analyze the impact of IoT on digital forensics and systematize the research efforts made by previous researchers from 2010 to 2018. We sketch the landscape of IoT forensics and examine the state of IoT forensics under a 3-D framework. The 3-D framework consists of a temporal dimension, a spatial dimension, and a technical dimension. The temporal dimension walks through the standard digital forensic process while the spatial dimension explores where to identify sources of evidence in IoT environment. These two dimensions attempt to provide principles and guidelines for standardizing digital investigations in the context of IoT. The technical dimension guides a way to the exploration of tools and techniques to ensure the enforcement of digital forensics in the ever-evolving IoT environment.

Researchers proposed an automated tool called fault and behavior monitoring tool for PLC (FBMTP) whose main advantage is its ability to effectively handle inaccuracies with large-scale PLC-controlled manufacturing systems. Although FBMTP effectively addresses the issues in PLC-controlled systems, only the Boolean I/O signals (1/0) intercepted from the memory area of the PLC are examined. However, PLC I/O often involves analog signals, which are real values. Therefore, we introduced a new parameter to increase the diversity of this mechanism, an improved fault and behavior monitoring tool for PLC (IFBMTP). Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technology is applied across various fields. In the manufacturing sector, it is used for real-time monitoring, production control, and information sharing, enhancing the flexibility of manufacturing systems. Moreover, CPS is practical for simulating and testing different fault detection models, such as IFBMTP, given the limited availability of large-scale equipment for testing in industries. Presently, many software platforms focus primarily on animation or integer computations but cannot accurately reflect physical analog data, making integration among multiple technologies challenging. Automation Studio, developed by Famic Technologies Inc., stands out for its rapid modeling, multi-technology integration, and application in virtual commissioning. We leveraged Automation Studio as the development platform to create an integrated CPS and validated the robustness of IFBMTP under various scenarios for debugging and testing. Such integration of multiple technological virtual systems is essential for industrial applications and validations.","","979-8-3503-6072-1","10.1109/ICEIB61477.2024.10602607","National Science and Technology Council(grant numbers:113-2914-1-033 −004 -A1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10602607","smart manufacturing;Automation Studio;virtual system;PLC fault diagnosis;predictive maintenance (PdM)","Automation;Costs;Fault detection;Debugging;Cyber-physical systems;Stability analysis;Robustness","","","","12","IEEE","2 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many safety critical application domains, runtime monitors (or runtime verification) are used to enforce operational safety and security. One of the challenges in runtime verification is to identify the critical safety properties that we want to monitor at runtime. In this paper, we explore how structural verification activities in a Model Based Design and Engineering (MBDE) context help formulate more effective monitoring specifications to cover vulnerable areas in a system. We assert that leveraging synergy between design and runtime verification produces more informed runtime safety monitors. This approach of integrating design assurance and runtime safety and security is an important aspect of the dependable DevOps continuum process. To demonstrate this, we perform verification of an Emergency Diesel Generator Startup Sequencer (EDGSS) implemented on an FPGA overlay architecture using model-based verification techniques.

To address this issue, we propose a graphics-processing-unit-enabled adaptive robust state estimator. It comprises a deep learning algorithm, long short-term memory, and a nonlinear extended Kalman filter, and is called LSTMKF. Through an SDIoT controller, it provides an online parametric state estimate.

Drift diagnosis process is a challenging problem in this context and artificial intelligence technologies are promising to tackle this issue. In this paper, we propose a new approach of DSS for drift diagnosis. The proposed approach is built upon a literature review on drift concept, drift detection methods and failure diagnosis approaches. This multi-model approach is designed to address all the diagnostics tasks of production systems and is based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to model the behavior of production systems, a knowledge-based model to integrate human experiences and a data-driven model to combine historical data from sensors. When the drift occurs, the proposed DSS can help human operator to determine drift causes and to suggest corrective actions.

A manual construction of the attack graphs is tedious and error-prone, this paper proposes a model-checking-based automated attack graph generator and visualizer (A2G2V). The proposed A2G2V algorithm uses existing model-checking tools, an architecture description tool, and our own code to generate an attack graph that enumerates the set of all possible sequences in which atomic-level vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise system security. The architecture description tool captures a formal representation of the networked system, its atomic vulnerabilities, their pre-and post-conditions, and security property of interest. A model-checker is employed to automatically identify an attack sequence in the form of a counterexample. Our own code integrated with the model-checker parses the counterexamples, encodes those for specification relaxation, and iterates until all attack sequences are revealed. Finally, a visualization tool has also been incorporated with A2G2V to generate a graphical representation of the generated attack graph.

Blockchain is a novel technology, which has gained a lot of attention in the last years, mainly due to its use as a backbone for cryptocurrencies. The main purpose of blockchain technology is to provide anonymous transactions between participants, over a peer-to-peer network, using a decentralized distributed ledger. The goal of this novel approach is to eliminate any 3rd party validation and replace the trust of a central authority for transaction validation with cryptographic proof. While most applications of the blockchain revolve around cryptocurrencies, the blockchain can be used in many other fields, such as finance, distributed data storage, health and medicine, automation, etc. By creating an open, decentralized network, the blockchain can be used to develop decentralized applications and enable data access and sharing on a much higher level than the common implementations of client-server architectures which are in use today. In this paper, we will present a proof of concept method for field devices to store and share data using a distributed ledger built on the IOTA tangle, as well as provide means of access to the data which can be used in IoT and decentralized applications.","","978-1-5386-5683-9","10.1109/MECO.2018.8406041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406041","blockchain;internet of things;decentralized;distributed;data provider;tangle","Cryptography;Peer-to-peer computing;Distributed databases;Embedded computing;Internet of Things;Computers","","34","","9","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a double protection scheme is effective in mitigating various malicious attacks and can provide a high standard security for the IoT system. Furthermore, FOCUS is implemented in fog computing that is close to the end users, thus achieving a fast response and an efficient network consumption.

Indeed, on the one hand, at design-time, most often we do not know which are the concrete IoT systems that will become constituents of the SoS, these being predominantly identified at run-time; on the other hand, the correct architecture depends not only on the constituent systems but also, largely, on the operational environment where the SoS will be deployed. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the notion of self-organization, whose mechanism makes possible that the IoT constituent systems themselves create and maintain a valid architecture enabling the production of the required emergent behavior to fulfil the SoS mission. In particular, it describes how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), based on the novel π-Calculus for SoS, supports the architectural description of self-organizing SoSs for the IoT, upwardly causing SoS emergent behaviors at run-time.","","978-1-5090-5945-4","10.1109/SYSOSE.2017.7994959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7994959","Internet-of-Things;Self-Organization;Emergence;Software Architecture;System-of-Systems","Organizations;Chaos;Computer architecture;Standards organizations;Chemistry;Entropy;Liquids","","12","","39","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The wireless sensors relay their packets on to the base station via multi-hop transmissions and the overall functioning of the system, therefore, is dependent on these intermediate nodes. However, unbalanced data forward amongst the nodes results in high-energy consumption and packets drop. The network lifetime and link reliability are the most important factors for the network to work for longer period of time, hence optimum selection of the paths for packet routing is key for prolonged network life. This paper proposes a link quality-oriented route (LQOR) protocol for scalable IoT networks. The main goal of this scheme is to balance the network load by intelligently selecting the next hop with less number of neighbouring nodes. The comparative performance evaluation corroborates the positive impact of the algorithm as compared to other related techniques existing in the literature. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves less packets loss and average number of paths, minimizing data retransmissions. This effectively improves the overall system performance and elongates the network lifetime.","","978-1-5386-1335-1","10.1109/CSNDSP.2018.8471884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8471884","Internet of Things (IoT);Link Quality;Link Reliability;Green Computing;Packets Loss;Wireless Sensor Network (WSN);Network Lifetime","Wireless sensor networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Mathematical model;Internet of Things;Artificial neural networks","","11","","19","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In IoT environments, authentication is a big challenge because of the heterogeneity in protocols, devices, and topologies. IoT devices that communicate with each other need to be authentic, in order to avoid different types of attacks that are related to the negligence of authentication.

In recent years, so there are many studies that have used classification techniques like an algorithm decision tree to train and validate modeling to define these botnet attacks, but they still produced high errors in assist investigating botnet traces.

IoT applications are present in many fields ranging from mining and exploration to security and surveillance. This arguably, is the second Internet revolution. For traditional internet applications, the wireless channel is the main communication medium. IoT networked applications, however, can be deployed in different environments such as underwater and subterranean. In these environments, the wireless communication medium is obviously not air. Radio signal suffers severe attenuation in water. In contrast, acoustic signal performs much better. For this reason acoustic signal is often considered in underwater IoT networks. Several factors affect the propagation of acoustic signal in water including frequency, distance, temperature, shipping activity, wind, salinity, depth and density. Given the many variables affecting the channel, simple mathematical modeling is not adequate and comprehensive models get very complex very quickly. Simulation modeling then becomes the only viable alternative for the modeling and analysis of underwater networks. Aside from a basic model in ns-2 & ns-3, there aren't any other simulators that model signal propagation for underwater environments. In this work, we develop a module for the acoustic channel in JiST/SWANS (Java in Simulation Time / Scalable Wireless Ad hoc Network Simulator). JiST/SWANS is a high-performance discrete event simulator written in Java, and it is very efficient in its memory usage. This makes it ideal for modeling and simulation of a large number of nodes, a typical scenario in IoT networks. We perfomed several simulation scenarios to validate our module.

But this connectedness also leads to more challenges in data security and the increased risk of cyber-attacks. Improved, and faster, security schemes have become a key requirement of these loT technologies. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been used to accelerate various cyber-security algorithms. However, while FPGAs are capable of massive computational power, through their highly parallel nature, they are generally difficult to program; and considering the design of modern encryption schemes this is posing a significant bottleneck to progress in security for these architectures. This paper investigates the use of a Python-based high-level FPGA design tool-flow for rapid prototyping of loT cryptosystems. In this paper we implement a version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, with block and key sizes of 128bits, using the Python-based tool-flow. The design is functionally verified, a Verilog hardware implementation is generated, simulated and then executed on an FPGA platform. The performance of the resulting FPGA design is analyzed in terms of resource utilization and throughput, and is compared against similar hand-written AES implementations reported in the literature. We found our FPGA implementation had a frequency of 512.742 MHz and a throughput of 65.63Gbps which is more than fast enough for most IoT applications.","","978-1-5386-7972-2","10.1109/ICMIMT.2019.8712074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8712074","component;Internet of Things (loT);cyber-security;rapid prototyping;FPGA","Field programmable gate arrays;Ciphers;Internet of Things;Hardware;Encryption;Hardware design languages","","4","","22","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this limitation of CoAP, there is a simple extension of the CoAP using a clustering approach: cluster-based CoAP for message queueing. In this paper, we propose an enhanced cluster-based CoAP scheme for efficient gathering of sensing data. By using a cache memory on the cluster head, the communication performance can be improved in the IoT networks.

The leakage of these data will cause very serious consequences. Traditional access control is prone to single point of failure. The existing researches on the combination of blockchain and access control have some disadvantages, such as the difficulty of managing access rights, inefficient access efficiency, and the difficulty of supporting lightweight IOT devices. This paper proposes an IoT access control model based on blockchain smart contract, called SCBAC. Firstly, by adopting the idea of IoT Attributes Based Access Control(ABAC), the model supports a dynamic, fine-grained access control. Secondly, by deploying the access control strategy on the blockchain in the form of smart contracts, the computing pressure of IoT devices is reduced, so that the model can be applied to lightweight IoT devices and has tamper resistance and traceability characteristics. The idea of tokens is adopted into the strategy, and subjects obtain access rights by applying for tokens in advance, which improves access efficiency. In addition, Trust recommendation algorithm is adopted in the model, which effectively solves the problem of identity fraud in access control. Finally, we build a prototype system to verify this proposed model, through case analysis and security analysis, it shows that this access control model is effective and versatile. Furthermore, the model can be used as a reference for other IoT applications with access control security requirements.","2689-6621","978-1-7281-8028-1","10.1109/IAEAC50856.2021.9390662","North China University of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9390662","Internet of Thing;Access control;Smart contracts;Blockchain","Access control;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Permission;Internet of Things","","3","","19","IEEE","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the exponential increase of smart devices and their applications, collecting and analysing data is gradually becoming one of the most difficult tasks. As sensor nodes are battery powered, energy efficiency is essential. To that intention, before passing the data to the base station, a sensor node should reduce redundancy in the data received from neighbour nodes. There will be some redundancy in the data because different sensor nodes typically notice the same phenomenon. Data aggregation is one of the most important approaches for eliminating data redundancy and improving energy efficiency, as well as extending the life time of wireless sensor networks.

The model includes ingredients such as trustor, trustee, goal, trustworthiness evaluation, decision, action, result, and context. Building on this trust model, we clarify the concepts of trust in the social IoT in five aspects such as: (1) mutuality of trustor and trustee; (2) inferential transfer of trust; (3) transitivity of trust; (4) trustworthiness update; and (5) trustworthiness affected by dynamic environment. With network connectivities that are from real-world social networks, simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the social IoT operated with the proposed trust model.

We propose a new energy-aware objective function for the RPL routing protocol which combines the nodes link quality and their residual energy to improve the network latency and at the same time prolong the life of the sensor nodes.
