Security strength and the immunity to security attacks depend mainly on the available power budget. The power-security level trade-off is the main challenge for low power IoT applications, especially, energy limited IoT applications. In this paper, multiple encryption modes that provide different power consumption and security level values are hardware implemented. In other words, some modes provide high security levels at the expense of high power consumption and other modes provide low power consumption with low security level. Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) is utilized to adaptively configure the hardware security module based on the available power budget. For example, for a given power constraint, the DPR controller configures the security module with the security mode that meets the available power constraint. ZC702 evaluation board is utilized to implement the proposed encryption modes using DPR. A Lightweight Authenticated Cipher (ACORN) is the most suitable encryption mode for low power IoT applications as it consumes the minimum power and area among the selected candidates at the expense of low throughput. The whole DPR system is tested with a maximum dynamic power dissipation of 10.08 mW. The suggested DPR system saves about 59.9% of the utilized LUTs compared to the individual implementation of the selected encryption modes.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-0397-6","10.1109/ISCAS.2019.8702315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8702315","Internet of Things (IoT);Security;Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR);Encryption Modes;Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security;Applicability and Robustness (CAESAR)","Encryption;Internet of Things;Hardware;Ciphers;Throughput","","10","","21","IEEE","1 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The onboarding procedure is required to introduce a new device in a System of Systems (SoS) without compromising the already onboarded devices and the underlying infrastructure. Onboarding is the process of providing access to the network and registering the components for the first time in an IoT/SoS framework, thus creating a chain of trust from the hardware device to its hosted software systems and their provided services. The large number and diversity of device hardware, software systems and running services raises the challenge to establish a generic onboarding procedure. In this paper, we present an automated and secure onboarding procedure for SoS. We have implemented the onboarding procedure in the Eclipse Arrowhead framework. However, it can be easily adapted for other IoT/SoS frameworks that are based on Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) principles.

These demands call for the joint consideration of resilience and mixed criticality to exploit previously untapped redundancy potentials. Hereby, resilience combines detection, decision-making, adaption to, and recovery from unforeseeable or malicious events in an autonomous manner. Enabling the consideration of functionalities with different criticalities, mixed criticality allows prioritizing safety-relevant over uncritical functions. While both concepts on their own feature a huge research branch throughout various disciplines of engineering-related fields, the synergies of both paradigms in a multi-disciplinary context are commonly overlooked. In industrial control, consolidating these mechanisms while preserving functional safety requirements under limited resources is a significant challenge. In this contribution, we provide a multi-disciplinary perspective of the concepts and mechanisms that enable criticality-aware resilience, in particular with respect to system design, communication, control, and security. Thereby, we envision a highly flexible, autonomous, and scalable paradigm for industrial control systems, identify potentials along the different domains, and identify future research directions. Our results indicate that jointly employing mixed criticality and resilience has the potential to increase the overall systems efficiency, reliability, and flexibility, even against unanticipated or malicious events.

Often restrictions at the device level or on the available bandwidth limit the ability to capture all locally available data required for processing and analysis. In this research, we present a novel method for extracting sound from video data where no original sound was present. Our novel method of sound synthesis first uses the image features output from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine class prediction weights using an advanced Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is then used to generate the representative sound of the predicted class for the input video sample. By combining the output of many Auto Sound Generators in a System of Systems framework, we show that new applications emerge that were never before possible.","","978-1-7281-8050-2","10.1109/SoSE50414.2020.9130483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9130483","Internet of Things;sound synthesis;video class prediction;deep neural network;generative adversarial network;auto sound generators;cross-modal learning","Neural networks;Generative adversarial networks;Generators;Sensors;Internet of Things;Convolutional neural networks;Modeling","","4","","25","IEEE","1 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work is modern manifestation of three laws of computing. Moore's and Koomey's laws recommend performance gain and energy efficiency whereas Metcalfe's law imply network scalability. Combination of these laws suggests the research proposition that development of scalable and performance efficient IoT networks is inevitable. Although IoT has improved specific logistics modules considerably, but incorporation of IoT in complete supply chain of food and random placement of IoT devices due to which unstable coverage and connectivity occurred are major challenges in logistics. The proposed SLCPS framework is designed firstly, to develop apt IoT protocol stack for logistics. Secondly, for bonded connectivity and coverage, mathematical models are proposed instead of random placement and coverage map is based on binary coverage model. Thirdly, for scalability supply chain of food for smart logistics process is designed in terms of container, storehouse and warehouse comprising of varying number of IoT devices. The architecture of SLCPS framework has three modules i.e. internal IoT network, border router and external network, emulated in Cooja simulator.

The performance evaluation results, i.e. throughput, network convergence time, packet delivery ratio, average latency, power consumption and timeline investigation validated utilization of proposed framework in terms of enhanced network performance. Significance of proposed SLCPS framework results in cost minimization, reducing communication and computation overhead, resilience to IoT device failures and an interference free network connectivity and coverage.

For example, military commanders recognize that in order to confront threats from high-tech adversaries, an advanced system of systems (SoS) is required to coordinate combat across multiple battlefield domains: land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), along with associated Modeling and Simulation (M&S) tools, can fill some of this need, especially for operational decision-support for complex multi-domain environments. This paper presents an M&S-based SoSE approach for complex SoS composed of deterministic and non-deterministic subsystems supported with reinforcement learning. The paper presents this new methodology, use cases, and preliminary results that address specific SoS challenges for a set of complex decision-support challenges.","","978-1-6654-4454-5","10.1109/SOSE52739.2021.9497496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497496","Modeling and Simulation;Complexity;System of Systems;Deterministic / Nondeterministic;Multi-Domain;Machine Learning;Reinforcement Learning","Atmospheric modeling;Face recognition;Military systems;Cyberspace;Reinforcement learning;Tools;System of systems","","","","20","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To actively detect physical faults that may affect SoS and adapt the overall operating modes, a resilience approach is proposed, composed of both bottom-up monitoring and top-down reconfiguration strategies. Based on the fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithm that is applied to cyber-physical component systems (CPCS), located at the bottom level, a bottom-up monitoring is enabled detecting faulty behaviors and informing the supervisor at a higher level of the fault information. Meanwhile, upon the received fault information, the supervisor is able sending instructions to component systems at lower levels to optimize the performance of the whole SoS, which is named as top-down reconfiguration. Compared with previous works mainly performing the reconfiguration from only one aspect, this work develops a comprehensive reconfiguration framework from communication, operational independence and mission perspectives based on hypergraph drawn from related viewpoints. A case study on a SoS composed of intelligent autonomous vehicles (IAV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are given finally to validate the effectiveness of theoretical results.","","978-1-6654-9623-0","10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812688","system-of-systems (SoS);hypergraph modelling;machine learning;resilience;fault detection and isolation (FDI);reconfiguration","Analytical models;Adaptation models;Fault detection;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Behavioral sciences;Vehicle dynamics;Monitoring","","8","","16","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A resilience index is then proposed for measuring the effectiveness of restoration activities in terms of restoration rapidity. After modeling operators' decision making for economic dispatch as a second-order cone programming problem, this paper proposes a heuristic approach for prioritizing the activities for restoring both cyber and physical subsystems.

An SoS operates in an environment with dynamically changing external conditions. Therefore, supporting the resilience of the SoS is crucial to sustain goal achievement at run-time. One way to support this resilience is to generate an adaptation strategy at run-time that guides the dynamic reconfiguration of the SoS. Therefore, adaptation strategies should be effectively generated within a reasonable time at run-time to conduct the dynamic reconfiguration in time. To satisfy this requirement, we propose an adaptation strategy generation approach that consists of two phases. 1) At design time, our approach constructs a knowledge base that contains adaptation strategies for expected environmental conditions. 2) At/during run-time, it generates adaptation strategies by utilizing the knowledge base. Through a case study, we show that our approach can generate adaptation strategies effectively at run-time.","","978-1-6654-4454-5","10.1109/SOSE52739.2021.9497463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497463","System of Systems (SoS);Self-Adaptation;Adaptation strategy;Multi-objective optimization (MOO)","Heuristic algorithms;Knowledge based systems;Sociology;Planning;Statistics;Optimization;System of systems","","","","12","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Historically, cyber security has emphasized building defenses to prevent loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in digital information and systems, but in recent years cyber attacks have demonstrated that no system is impenetrable and that control system operation may be detrimentally impacted. Cyber resilience has emerged as a complementary priority that seeks to ensure that digital systems can maintain essential performance levels, even while capabilities are degraded by a cyber attack. This paper examines how cyber security and cyber resilience may be measured and quantified in a control system environment. Load Frequency Control is used as an illustrative example to demonstrate how cyber attacks may be represented within mathematical models of control systems, to demonstrate how these events may be quantitatively measured in terms of cyber security or cyber resilience, and the differences and similarities between the two mindsets. These results demonstrate how various metrics are applied, the extent of their usability, and how it is important to analyze cyber-physical systems in a comprehensive manner that accounts for all the various parts of the system.","","978-1-5386-6913-6","10.1109/RWEEK.2018.8473549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8473549","Cyber Security;Cyber Resilience;Cyber-Physical Systems;Control Systems;Load Frequency Control","Resilience;Control systems;Cyberattack;Frequency measurement","","20","","37","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Industrial CPS in particular need to simultaneously satisfy requirements of available, secure, safe and reliable system operation against diverse threats, in an adaptive and sustainable way. These adverse events can be of accidental or malicious nature and may include natural disasters, hardware or software faults, cyberattacks, or even infrastructure design and implementation faults. They may drastically affect the results of CPS algorithms and mechanisms, and subsequently the operations of industrial control systems (ICS) deployed in those critical infrastructures. Such a demanding combination of properties and threats calls for resilience-enhancement methodologies and techniques, working in real-time operation. However, the analysis of CPS resilience is a difficult task as it involves evaluation of various interdependent layers with heterogeneous computing equipment, physical components, network technologies, and data analytics. In this paper, we apply the principles of chaos engineering (CE) to industrial CPS, in order to demonstrate the benefits of such practices on system resilience. The systemic uncertainty of adverse events can be tamed by applying runtime CE-based analyses to CPS in production, in order to predict environment changes and thus apply mitigation measures limiting the range and severity of the event, and minimizing its blast radius.","","978-1-6654-2905-4","10.1109/RWS52686.2021.9611797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611797","Cyber-physical systems;industrial control systems;chaos engineering;resilience","Chaos;Uncertainty;Systems operation;Software algorithms;Transportation;Cyber-physical systems;Critical infrastructure","","7","","52","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, designing a secure and resilient WES is critical. This paper first proposes a system-of-systems (SoS) framework for the cyber-physical WES. Specifically, on the one hand, we adopt a game-theoretic model to capture the interactions between the WES system defender and the adversary at the cyber layer. The outcome of this cyber defense game is reflected by control-aware Nash equilibria. On the other hand, we devise a cyber-aware robust and resilient switching controller based on a Markov jump linear system model for the physical WES. The performances of the WES cyber and physical layers are interdependent due to their natural couplings. We further investigate the SoS equilibrium of the integrated WES, which considers the system security, robustness, and resilience holistically. Finally, we use case studies to corroborate the developed cross-layer design principles for the cyber-physical WES. Note to Practitioners—Cybersecurity becomes a critical concern of wind energy system (WES) operators as an increasing amount of IoT devices are adopted for WES’s communication, monitoring, and operation support purposes. This cyber-physical integration in WES creates a much broader attack surface because adversaries can compromise the physical WES by attacking its dependent cyberspace. To mitigate the impact of attacks, the operator should not only design intelligent control strategies for WES but also strategically secure the WES’s cyber layer. These two goals are naturally coupled together. On the one hand, the WES operates under different compromised conditions depending on the attack actions at the cyber layer. Thus, the control design needs to be adversary-aware by taking the real-time cyber state into account. On the other hand, the adversary’s cyberattack strategy is influenced by the induced performance degradation of WES. Hence, the corresponding attack measures and countermeasures, in turn, should be physically control-aware. This paper establishes a holistic mathematical framework to simultaneously address these two challenging objectives. The obtained solution provides guidelines for the WES operator on the optimal security resource investment in defending against cyberattacks and the robust switching control design to mitigate the impacts of attacks further. This methodology creates a defense-in-depth paradigm for the WES operators to maintain the energy system efficiency in the adversarial environment. This cross-layer design approach is also efficient and user-friendly for online implementation with the developed iterative algorithm. The simulated-based case studies in this paper show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, a more thorough validation of the method in practice is necessary before its integration with the production standard.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3164860","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2138956,ECCS-1847056,CNS-2027884,BCS-2122060); Department of Energy-Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE)(grant numbers:20-19829); Army Research Office (ARO)(grant numbers:W911NF-19-1-0041); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9755939","Wind energy system;cyber-physical security;cross-layer design;switching control;interdependence","Control systems;Switches;Wind energy;Physical layer;Cross layer design;Wind farms;Resilience","","22","","35","IEEE","12 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The perception layer provides a unique challenge for intrusion detection where resources are constrained and networks are distributed. An additional challenge is that IoT networks are a continuous non-stationary data stream that, due to their variable nature, are likely to experience concept drift. This research aimed to review the practical applications of online machine learning methods for IoT network intrusion detection, to answer the question if a resource efficient architecture can be provided? An online learning architecture is introduced, with related IDS approaches reviewed and evaluated. Online learning provides a potential memory and time efficient architecture that can adapt to concept drift and perform anomaly detection, providing solutions for the resource constrained and distributed IoT perception layer. Future research should focus on addressing class imbalance in the data streams to ensure that minority attack classes are not missed.","","978-1-7281-4873-1","10.1109/GCIoT47977.2019.9058410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9058410","Internet of Things;Intrusion Detection;Online Machine Learning;Concept Drift;Anomaly Detection","Adaptation models;Intrusion detection;Internet of Things;Data models;Time complexity;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning","","12","","21","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Emergence is often the result of innovation within an SoS. We contend that, because of the complex adaptive nature of SoS, the assessment of the potential for innovation to create positive change is necessary for effective evolutionary planning. Innovation potential represents the convergence of three systems: the system of interest, the innovation system, and the context where these interact and come together. The three-system model is a useful perspective to assess the potential impact of innovation on the evolution of an SoS, and to describe the context of SoS emergence as enabled or constrained by its innovation system. We describe a set of methods and tools adapted from both SoS engineering and human-centered design which can be used for strategic design and planning of SoS evolution.

Key components include a capability ontology, session-type information for sequencing and concurrent operations, and an integrated development environment (IDE) for automated control design. The capability ontology standardizes machine capabilities, facilitating device integration based on their capabilities, while session-type information ensures correct sequencing and synchronization of machine functions. The IDE platform supports dynamic reconfiguration by automating device selection, control strategy formulation, and system adjustments across diverse use cases. The architecture has been validated in real-world scenarios, including smart meeting rooms, warehouse automation, and energy management, showing a reduction in manual configuration time (up to 50%), development time (86% in some cases), and error rates (30%).

Architecting such PSS-SoS goes beyond classic SoS engineering, as they are often driven by new technology, without an a priori client and actor network, and thus, a much larger number of potential architectures. However, it seems that neither the existing PSS nor SoS literature provides solutions to how to architect such PSS. This paper presents a methodology for architecting PSS-SoS that are driven by technological innovation. The objective is to design PSS-SoS architectures together with their value proposition and business model from an initial technology impact assessment. For this purpose, we adapt approaches from the strategic management, business modeling, PSS and SoS architecting literature.

SoS often involve complex interactions and interdependencies between systems, and as a result, they can be challenging to design, manage, and maintain. Resilience is the ability of a system to withstand and recover from disruptive events. When considering a system of systems, resilience becomes a key factor as disruptions in one system may have a cascading effect on the other systems. To ensure resilience in such complex environment, constraint programming (CP) can be used to model and optimize the system's behavior, and to find the optimal configuration that satisfies all constraints. This approach can help identify the best reconfiguration options that meet specific objectives, such as maximizing system performance, minimizing costs, or minimizing risks. Compared to previous works that primarily performs SoS reconfiguration by moving the failed system into a degraded operating mode to maintain acceptable functioning, this work focuses on a type of system failure, so that degraded mode is not possible. A constraint-based reconfiguration approach is developed, allowing the system to continue operating efficiently in the face of unexpected events.

This paper lays forth a thorough plan to improve cyber-physical security by bolstering intrusion detection systems (IDS) with the use of digital twin technology (DTT). Virtual representations of physical systems, or ""digital twins,"" allow for sophisticated modelling, predictive analytics, and real-time monitoring. Incorporating DTT with IDS allows for proactive and dynamic threat detection and response in this system. Datasets generated by an ICS testbed— a device designed to monitor storage reservoir water levels and turbulence—form the basis of the suggested architecture. The SCADA system uses a number of indicators to assess the efficacy of several machine learning (ML) models that are used to detect and categorize intrusions. The findings show that ML approaches are great at detecting intrusions, with low false positive rates and high detection rates. Also, the IDS can now identify more complex and unique assaults because to DTT's incorporation, which enables continuous system learning and adaptability. An important step forward in cyber-physical security, this research shows that digital twins have the ability to change intrusion detection systems (IDS) from reactive to proactive. The framework offers a durable and scalable approach to safeguard vital infrastructures from ever-changing cyber threats, and its ramifications reach into a wide range of industrial applications. The integration of Digital Twin Technology (DTT) with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for cyber-physical security showed significant improvements in threat detection. Test results revealed a 40% increase in early intrusion detection accuracy compared to traditional IDS models.

First, we present three hybrid distributed stabilization architectures for cyber-physical network systems to achieve the robust performance of geospatial physical networks by mimicking the dynamic behavior of thermodynamic systems. The proposed stabilization architectures are constructed in such a way that each stabilizer has a one-directional energy transfer from a plant to itself, and exchanges energy with its neighboring stabilizers. Second, to balance resilience to cascading failures and efficiency of energy flow in geospatially distributed physical networks, we propose an entropy metric-based multiobjective optimization framework for network topology design to characterize this resilience-efficiency trade-off design in networks. Moreover, we propose a novel cascade-connectivity swarm optimization algorithm which combines swarm intelligence and graph theory together to solve this multiobjective optimization problem.

The Internet of Things (IoT) has the ability to radically alter the telecom business, according to this research. on network architecture, service delivery, and business models. To begin, IoT enables the development of smarter, more robust network infrastructure by deploying linked devices and sensors. These devices offer real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and proactive management of network infrastructure, resulting in increased dependability, lower downtime, and better resource usage. Second, IoT-driven data analytics and insights enable telecommunications firms to provide customized services and experiences to their consumers. Telecom companies may increase their service offerings and income streams by using massive volumes of data created by connected devices. Examples include smart home automation, linked automobiles, and industrial IoT applications. Furthermore, IoT accelerates the transition to 5G networks by opening up new use cases and applications that need ultra-low latency, high dependability, and huge connection. From self-driving cars to remote healthcare monitoring, IoT expands the capabilities of 5G networks, opening up new opportunities for companies and consumers alike. Despite its enormous promise, IoT in the telecommunications business poses security, privacy, interoperability, and scalability concerns. Addressing these concerns needs strong cybersecurity measures, industry standards, and stakeholder engagement to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and resilience of IoT-enabled networks and services.

Even though CPPS have many possibilities to adapt to faults like using an alternative path or redundant hardware, the full potential is not exploited: Nowadays, the control software of CPPS is static and not able to adapt to unforeseen situations like an unknown fault. Hence, CPPS are not able to adapt to faults but a machine operator needs to reconfigure the system manually. Reconfiguration is the task of recovering valid system behavior after a fault has occurred. To enable CPPS to adapt autonomously to faults, automated reconfiguration is necessary. But since CPPS usually are dynamic systems consisting of interconnections of various components, identifying the necessary changes for reconfiguration is challenging: The effects of changes may only manifest after some time and lead to deviations in components far away from their root. This paper presents an approach on automated reconfiguration for CPPS, i.e. the automated recovery from faults. The approach is based on the usage of a logical calculus that reasons about the consequences of a fault and the possible adaptions. Therefore, the system is modeled in terms of logic. Gradient information is integrated to capture the system dynamics. The applicability of the algorithm is shown using a benchmark system from process engineering. Thus, CPPS are enabled to adapt to faults autonomously.","","978-1-7281-6207-2","10.1109/ICPS49255.2021.9468238","Fraunhofer; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468238","automated reconfiguration;cyber-physical production systems;fault handling;resilience","Production systems;System dynamics;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Cyber-physical systems;Software;Hardware","","6","","42","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address an SoS-level goal that cannot be satisfied by each CS, an SoS policy guides or forces the CSs to collaborate with each other. If there is a fault in the SoS policy, SoS may fail to reach its goal, even if there is no fault in the CSs. Such a call for SoS policy testing leads to an essential question-how can testers evaluate the effectiveness of test cases?In this paper, we suggest a mutation analysis approach for SoS policy testing. Mutation analysis is a systematic way of evaluating test cases using artificial faults called mutants. As a general mutation framework for SoS policy testing, we present an overview of mutation analysis in SoS policy testing as well as the key aspects that must be defined in practice. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, we provide a case study using a traffic management SoS with the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulator.

Besides their dynamic architecture with continuous changes at runtime, SoS should be reliable and work without interrupting their operation and with no failures that could cause accidents or losses. SoS architectural design should facilitate the prediction of the impact of architectural changes and potential failures due to SoS behavior. However, existing approaches do not support such evaluation. Hence, these systems have been usually built without a proper evaluation of their architecture. This article presents Dynamic-SoS, an approach to predict/anticipate at design time the SoS architectural behavior at runtime to evaluate whether the SoS can sustain their operation. The main contributions of this approach comprise: (i) characterization of the dynamic architecture changes via a set of well-defined operators; (ii) a strategy to automatically include a reconfiguration controller for SoS simulation; and (iii) a means to evaluate architectural configurations that an SoS could assume at runtime, assessing their impact on the viability of the SoS operation. Results of our case study reveal Dynamic-SoS is a promising approach that could contribute to the quality of SoS by enabling prior assessment of its dynamic architecture.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9266975","dynamic architecture;system-of-systems;simulation","","","7","","","","23 Nov 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

As a result, a reduction in the number of required measurements as well as the complexity of the sensor nodes is achieved. None of the previous works had studied the performance of DCS for sensed signals with abnormalities caused by sensor malfunctioning, sudden changes in temperature, or humidity.

There are serious security risks in designing IoT like poor authentication, data leakage, and DDoS attacks. In this review paper, how AI can secure IoT is discussed. A few AI-driven strategies that help mask all these weaknesses are also discussed regarding intrusion detection systems (IDS), behavioural analytics, anomaly detection, and real-time threat monitoring. It presents a four-layered IoT architecture consisting of perception, network, support, and application layers. The use of the IoT systems will become more flexible and efficient in data security and collection, secure and encrypted communication, and predictive security analytics.

CPES security evaluation is challenging since the physical and cyber layers are often not considered holistically. Existing literature focuses on only optimizing the operation of either the physical or cyber layer while ignoring the interactions between them. This article proposes a metric, the cyber–physical energy system quantitative security metric (CPES-QSM), that quantifies the interaction between the cyber and physical layers across three domains: 1) electrical; 2) cyber-risk; and 3) network topology. A method for incorporating the proposed cyber-metric into operational decisions is also proposed by formulating a cyber-constrained ac optimal power flow (C-ACOPF) that considers the status of all the CPES layers. The C-ACOPF considers the vulnerabilities of physical and cyber networks by incorporating factors such as voltage stability, contingencies, graph theory, and IoT cyber risks, while using a multicriteria decision-making technique. Simulation studies are conducted using standard IEEE test systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and the C-ACOPF formulation.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3210402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9904852","Cyber metric;cyber–physical energy systems (CPES);cybersecurity;optimal power flow (PF);optimization;power systems","Measurement;Load flow;Resilience;Internet of Things;Upper bound;Power system stability;Indexes","","3","","40","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The primary objective of this paper was to develop a generalized resilience analysis model for the characterization of multistate engineered systems subject to disruptions to support system design selection during trade studies. Each design variant within the tradespace is modeled using continuous time Markov chains that simulate the transient response of each design variant subject to a user-defined disruption. The operating condition of the multistate system is characterized by a finite number of machine states. Each design variant's utility response is generated as a function of the system's machine state response to the disruption. Resilience capacities and capabilities are generated to populate trade studies. A case study consisting of an unmanned surface vessel provides a system theoretic approach to illustrate the concepts presented within this paper and demonstrates the ability of this methodology to aid decision maker's selection of resilient system architectures. Use of an analytical framework serves as a unifying foundation for incorporating resilience behaviors of multistate engineered systems into early stage design considerations.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2017.2703608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7934048","Autonomous systems;resilience;robustness;systems analysis and design;systems engineering","Resilience;Modeling;Systems architecture;System analysis and design;Robustness","","9","","71","IEEE","25 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use knowledge graphs to model a Secure Water Treatment System (SWaT) test bed subsystem. We conduct a resilience assessment analysis of several designs with a quantitative metric. This resilience analysis, applied to each layer of our models, is also used to highlight critical points, e.g., the key functions or components that are significant for completing a mission.","1861-2288","978-3-903176-63-8","10.23919/IFIPNetworking62109.2024.10619809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10619809","Attack Path;Attack Propagation;Cascading Effect;Complex System;Cyber-Physical System;Cyber Re-silience;Cyber Threat;Knowledge Graph;Remediation Path;Resilience Enhancement;Resilience Quantification;Semantic Network","Measurement;Software algorithms;Knowledge graphs;Cyber-physical systems;Prediction algorithms;Software;Safety","","1","","28","","15 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such small probability but high risk events have huge impact on power systems. Most resilience research in power systems only considers faults on the physical side, which would lead to overly idealistic results. This paper proposes a two-stage cyber-physical resilience enhancement method considering energy storage (ES) systems. The first stage calculates optimal planning of ES systems, and the second stage assesses resilience and enhancement of ES systems during the disaster. In the proposed model, cyber faults indirectly damage the system by disabling monitoring and control function of control center. As a result, when detection and response process of physical faults are blocked by cyber failures, serious load shedding occurs. Such a cyber-physical coupling mechanism of fault, response, restoration process is demonstrated in the modified IEEE Reliable Test System-79 (RTS-79). Simulation results show compared with the physical-only system, the cyber-physical system has a more accurate but degraded resilient performance. Besides, ES systems setting at proper place effectively enhance resilience of the cyber-physical transmission system with less load Shedding.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2022.07570","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M710906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10376001","Cyber-physical faults;energy storage systems;resilience enhancement;transmission systems","Resilience;Storms;Ice;Planning;Wind speed;Wires;Indexes","","2","","41","","28 Dec 2023","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Such interdependence renders IoT systems vulnerable to random failures, e.g., broken communication links or crashed cyber instances, because a single incident in one domain can develop into a cascade-of-failures across domains, which dissolves the network structure, and has devastating consequences. To answer how robust an IoT system is, this paper studies its resilience by examining the impact of edge- and jointly-induced cascades, that is, a sequence of failures caused by randomly broken physical links (and simultaneous failing cyber nodes). Resilience of an IoT system is quantified by two new metrics, the critical edge disconnecting probability  $\phi _{cr}$ , i.e., the maximum intensity of random failures the system can withstand, and the cascade length  $\tau _{cf}$ , i.e., the lifetime of a cascade. For IoT systems with Poisson degree distributions, we derive exact solutions for the critical disconnecting probability  $\phi _{cr}$ , above which an edge-induced cascade will completely fragment the network. We also find that the critical condition  $\phi _{cr}$  marks a dichotomy of the expected cascade length  $\mathbb {E}(\tau _{cf})$ : for the super-critical ( $\phi > \phi _{cr}$ ) scenario, we obtain  $\mathbb {E}(\tau _{cf}) \sim \exp (1-\phi)$  through analysis, while for the subcritical scenario, we observe  $\mathbb {E}(\tau _{cf}) \sim \exp (1/1-\phi)$  through simulations. With these results, the final outcome of a cascade can be anticipated upon the initial failures, while the reaction window of time-sensitive countermeasures can be obtained before a cascade fully unfolds.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2913140","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1526152); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-15-2-0102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8698298","Interdependent networks;Internet of Things (IoT) architecture;network resilience","Internet of Things;Resilience;Measurement;Smart grids;Network topology;Computer crashes;Analytical models","","22","","27","IEEE","24 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among other data types, images are widely transmitted and utilized across various IIoT applications, ranging from sensor-generated visual data and real-time remote monitoring to quality control in production lines. The encryption of these images is essential for maintaining operational integrity, data confidentiality, and seamless integration with analytics platforms. This paper addresses these critical concerns by proposing a robust image encryption algorithm tailored for IIoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The algorithm combines Rule-30 cellular automata with chaotic scrambling and substitution. The Rule 30 cellular automata serves as an efficient mechanism for generating pseudo-random sequences that enable fast encryption and decryption cycles suitable for realtime sensor data in industrial settings. Most importantly, it induces non-linearity in the encryption algorithm. Furthermore, to increase the chaotic range and keyspace of the algorithm, which is vital for security in distributed industrial networks, a hybrid chaotic map, i.e., logistic-sine map is utilized. Extensive security analysis has been carried out to validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Results indicate that our algorithm achieves close-to-ideal values, with an entropy of 7.99 and a correlation of 0.002. This enhances the algorithm's resilience against potential cyber-attacks in the industrial domain.","2577-2465","979-8-3503-2928-5","10.1109/VTC2023-Fall60731.2023.10333478","Horizon Europe; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10333478","cellular automata;chaos;image encryption;industrial internet of things;industry 4.0;IIoT","Visualization;Vehicular and wireless technologies;Correlation;Automata;Cyber-physical systems;Entropy;Encryption","","4","","16","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The lightweight and low-power physical layer security (PLS) technology is employed to protect the information from eavesdropping. Taking the imperfect channel state information (CSI) into account, we formulate a problem to optimize the beamforming vector, artificial noise (AN), transmit power, and subcarrier assignment policy aiming to maximize the worst case sum secrecy rate under the Quality of Service (QoS) and power consumption constraints. Since the formulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to be solved, we decompose it into two joint optimization subproblems. The first is resource allocation with given subcarrier assignment, which is solved by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach. The second is subcarrier assignment solved by the matching theory.

The real potential of the IoT lies in facilitating largescale sharing of high-quality context-rich information through systems-of-IoT-systems, rather than IoT systems that operate as isolated technology silos. Real large-scale interoperability requires layers of standards, and each layer addresses different interoperability challenges. The SensorThings API data model seeks to tackle data interoperability at the data and informational layers of IoT platforms. SensorThings API is aligned to the ISO/OGC O&M data standard, and like O&M it is semi-structured. Semi-structured models allow for variance within implementations for different use-cases, which is both necessary and detrimental to systems interoperability.In this paper we propose that the SensorThings API data model should be defined as a set of archetypes, used to capture extensible domain concepts using a two-level modeling IoT systems design approach. Extending two-level modeling to the IoT using the SensorThings API as a base for domain concepts definition allows for a powerful framework to manage variance within systems implementation and maintaining semantic interoperability within systems-of-IoT-systems across diverse use-cases.","","978-1-5386-4980-0","10.1109/WF-IoT.2019.8767355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8767355","Internet of Things;SensorThings API;two-level modeling;interoperability;O&M;archetypes","Data models;Interoperability;Object oriented modeling;Adaptation models;Internet of Things;Standards;Ontologies","","","","19","IEEE","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the missing area was identified as an evaluation index of distribution system resilience. The difference in resilience between the two states of communication, normal and faulty, was defined as the impact of a faulty cyber subsystem on a power distribution system. Then, the cyber-physical interdependence was modelled as a mixed integer linear model based on network flow theory. Thirdly, the three recovery measures of priority restoration of power subsystems, priority restoration of cyber subsystems, and cyber-physical coordinated recovery are compared to obtain the optimal recovery strategy.

The experimental results demonstrate clearly that the evaluated smart home security cameras are very vul-nerable to the tested cyber-attacks, and do not deploy built-in efficient security features. As a consequence, this investigation contributes to confirm the belief that most current IoT based smart home devices are designed and built without sufficient security considerations and solutions and may not be very reliable in untrust and unsafe environments.","","978-1-6654-7964-6","10.1109/CIoT53061.2022.9766814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766814","Internet of Things (IoT);Smart home security cameras;Kali Linux;Denial of Service (DoS) attacks;Man-in-the-Middle (MiM) attack","Smart homes;Cameras;Reliability engineering;Robustness;Safety;Security;Internet of Things","","2","","20","IEEE","9 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Systems of systems differ from traditional systems in ways that require tailoring of systems engineering processes to successfully deliver their capabilities.[1] This paper describes the distinct characteristics of systems of systems that impact their reliability, discusses their unique challenges, and recommends strategies for managing them. DoD has shifted from a system perspective to a capability perspective where the value to users is the collective effect of a set of systems rather than any one system.[1-2] The SOS approach to meeting requirements remains a challenge when defense systems continue to demonstrate poor reliability during operationol testing (OT). Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) reported in 2015 to Congress that only “38 percent of systems that had an Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) or Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&E) met their reliability requirements.” [5] This leads to questions about how to better define capabilities, impacts to design and how to integrate and test at the SoS level to achieve reliable systems. [1-5] This paper looks at SoS and reliability from the perspective of systems engineering and addresses the questions: What are the critical characteristics of SoS that affect T&E and reliability? What are the reliability implications for SoS? This paper reviews the characteristics of SoS as they impact reliability, and how aspects of reliability are addressed by the practice of SoS SE.

Meanwhile, monitoring should minimize the resulting energy and traffic overhead; to leave the network unconstrained during its normal operation. To tackle this problem, several integrated optimization models and efficient algorithms were proposed during the course of PhD. Our activities and results cover the monitor placement and scheduling problems. The topology is represented by a graph, and several graph related optimization problems can be solved. We aim at realizing a polynomial-time solvable monitor placement algorithm. Furthermore, to minimize the monitoring overhead and maximize longevity, monitoring roles should be balanced and alternated amongst nodes; therefore, we target optimal monitor scheduling.

This trend is mainly supported by the application of interconnected components, which are managed in a distributed way, as impelled by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) or Cyber-physical Systems (CPS). While the complexity of these Systems of Systems (SoSs) is constantly rising, requirements engineering before actual implementing the system becomes increasingly difficult. Thus, comprehensive frameworks providing a foundation for model-based systems engineering, like the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) or the Software Platform Embedded Systems (SPES), have been introduced. Although providing a standardized methodology, missing formalizations impede the modeling of systems according to detailed architectural specifications. To address these issues, this paper introduces an approach for eliciting, specifying and managing requirements according to a particular process and aligned to architectural standards. In the end, the result is evaluated by a real-world case study.

The availability of accurate models is essential to investigate the impact of traffic patterns created by the introduction of new services such as those forecasted for the Internet of Things (IoT). The Poisson model has historically been a popular aggregated traffic model and has been extensively used by the IoT research community. However, the Poisson model implicitly assumes an infinite number of traffic sources, which may not be a valid assumption in various plausible application scenarios. The practical conditions under which the Poisson model is valid in the context of IoT have not been fully investigated, in particular under a finite (and possibly reduced) number of traffic sources with random inter-arrival times. In this context, this letter derives exact mathematical models for the packet inter-arrival times of aggregated IoT data traffic based on the superposition of a finite number of traffic sources, each of which is modelled based on real-world experimental data from typical IoT sensors (temperature, light and motion). The obtained exact models are used to explore the validity of the Poisson model, showing that it can be extremely inaccurate when a reduced number of traffic sources is considered.

That is, IoT systems are inherently tied to preemptive deployment in areas of interest, and seldom planned for agile deployment in areas of interest (e.g. forest fires) after it's service use has occurred. In remedy, this work will explore the utility of “summoning” drones that could augment MEC resources to improve responsiveness (e.g. introduce computational power within a single hop) or reduce the load on resource constrained devices in the field. The operation and coordination of such drones would build on established literature in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANets). This paper will focus on improving the agility of EC via drones in a coordinated FANet, aiming to enable rapid-dissemination of resources to EC systems that are experiencing high operational loads and/or lack of required resources.

A large number of IoT devices are application-specific which makes the network difficult to manage and change. The Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm brings a new perspective of solving the network rigidity issue. By introducing the OpenFlow protocol to the IoT network, the routing decisions can be translated into matching rules and actions in a programmable way, thus simplifying the network configuration and management. However, different from the wired domain, which uses a separate dedicated network for OpenFlow channel, the IoT devices have to communicate with the Controller in a multi-hop way. Since some IoT nodes are unstable due to the limited energy, environment or other factors, the multi-hop way results in an unstable control channel, which degrades the network performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a practical SDN-based network architecture for Internet of things. We propose an Optimal Control Channel (OCC) policy to select minimum number of nodes to establish a stable OpenFlow channel to reduce the performance loss caused by unstable IoT nodes. OCC establishes a stable control channel to bridge the IoT nodes and the Controller. Meanwhile, OCC is responsible for the control messages aggregation to further decrease the SDN-inherent control overheads. The experimental results show our architecture outperforms the original SDN-based scheme in terms of control overheads.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622900","Internet of Things;SDN;Control Overhead;Optimal Control Channel","Internet of Things;Optimal control;Spread spectrum communication;Computer science;Routing;Performance evaluation;Bridges","","1","","16","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Low quality of information about the current state, due to the impact of cyberattacks, can be the reason for incorrect control actions and, as a result, process failures in the EPS. Therefore, to provide normal functioning of EPSs, it becomes relevant to study the resilience of the information communication subsystem to cyberattacks when estimating the EPS state.

There are several self-adaptive approaches for system-of-systems in the literature. However, to handle defiant components, there is currently only one solution, called cautious adaptation, which relies on the use of AOP-based wrappers. That approach may not be appropriate for IoT systems since the components expose their communication API. Therefore, this paper proposes a new cautious adaptation approach for IoT SoS that adds three external components, the Configurator, the Observer and the Effector, that realize the MAPE control loop to apply behaviour adaptation.

In this paper, we purpose an architecture of Ensemble Learning based Network Intrusion Detection System named ELNIDS for detecting routing attacks against IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks. We implement four different ensemble based machine learning classifiers including Boosted Trees, Bagged Trees, Subspace Discriminant and RUSBoosted Trees. To evaluate proposed intrusion detection model we have used RPL-NIDDS17 dataset which contains packet traces of Sinkhole, Blackhole, Sybil, Clone ID, Selective Forwarding, Hello Flooding and Local Repair attacks. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. We observe that ensemble of Boosted Trees achieve the highest Accuracy of 94.5% while Subspace Discriminant method achieves the lowest Accuracy of 77.8 % among classifier validation methods. Similarly, an ensemble of RUSBoosted Trees achieves the highest Area under ROC value of 0.98 while lowest Area under ROC value of 0.87 is achieved by an ensemble of Subspace Discriminant among all classifier validation methods.

The selection of an appropriate framework results difficult due to the rising number of available frameworks and platforms, which offer different support for the aforementioned requirements. Therefore, this article investigates the features of seven prominent frameworks for the purpose of simplifying the selection of a suitable framework for an industrial application. The aim of this article is to present the recent developments and state-of-the-art of industrial IoT frameworks and provide a technical comparison of their features and characteristics.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.2993323","European Commission(grant numbers:737459); Arrowhead Tools project Joint Undertaking(grant numbers:826452); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099983","Frameworks;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);system of systems (SoS)","Industries;Automation;Internet of Things;Security;Interoperability;Production;Protocols","","80","","82","CCBY","26 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, based on the idea of nonsequential Monte-Carlo simulation, a mixed sampling method is proposed to determine the fault occurrence time and repair time of each circuit breaker in the fault set. In order to describe the change process of load after a successful attack, the response model of the power system is proposed using the optimal load reduction model based on the dc power flow.

The system of systems is composed of multiple platforms cooperating with each other to jointly perform system of systems missions, which are usually divided into multiple stages. Due to different mission requirements in different stages, the correlation relationship between platforms in the system of systems is time-varying. Traditional modeling methods, such as reliability block diagram model, fault tree model, and GO model, find it difficult to model the time-varying correlation relationship. In the dynamic models, Markov model can not model dynamic correlation relationships between platforms within the system of systems. Petri net model is difficult to provide accurate evaluation results for complex systems. Therefore, in this paper, the Kill chain network model is established to simulate and model system of systems missions. Firstly, the system of systems is regarded as a network, and platforms are regarded as various nodes. Secondly, define the nodes and edges of the network, and conduct mission reliability model, including network structure modeling and network behavior modeling. Finally, define criteria for mission success and evaluate mission reliability using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The modeling and evaluation method of this paper has the following innovative points and advantages. Firstly, it can model time-varying correlation relationships between platforms for multi-stage mission. Secondly, compared to reliability block diagram model, which only provides one mission reliability value, the mission reliability evaluated by proposed method changes over time. This supports both reliability design and evaluation, as well as synchronous simulation evaluation of reality and the model.","2575-2642","979-8-3503-2998-8","10.1109/ICRMS59672.2023.00087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10712420","Multi-Stage Mission Reliability of The System of Systems;Kill Chain Network;Time-Varying Correlation;Reliability Modeling and Evaluation","Correlation;Monte Carlo methods;Petri nets;Reliability engineering;Safety;Complex systems;Time-varying systems;Faces;System of systems;Fault trees","","","","9","IEEE","21 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We define two new resilience estimation metrics: k-steerability and l-monitorability. They aim at assisting designers to evaluate and increase the cyber-resilience of CPS when facing stealthy attacks. The k-steerability metric reflects the ability of a controller to act on individual plant state variables when, at least, k different groups of functionally diverse input signals may be processed. The l-monitorability metric indicates the ability of a controller to monitor individual plant state variables with l different groups of functionally diverse outputs. Paired together, the metrics lead to CPS reaching (k,l)-resilience. When k and l are both greater than one, a CPS can absorb and adapt to control-theoretic attacks manipulating input and output signals. We also relate the parameters k and l to the recoverability of a system. We define recoverability strategies to mitigate the impact of perpetrated attacks. We show that the values of k and l can be augmented by combining redundancy and diversity in hardware and software, in order to apply the moving target paradigm. We validate the approach via simulation and numeric results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3066108","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); European Commission (H2020 SPARTA Project)(grant numbers:830892); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378521","Cyber-physical systems;control theory;cyber-resilience;covert attacks;security metrics;attack remediation;recoverability;resilience estimation","Monitoring;Measurement;Liquids;Resilience;Mathematical model;Biomedical monitoring;Sensors","","11","","38","CCBY","15 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The IoT devices are usually wirelessly networked, and they serve as a key enabling technology for many critical smart city applications, such as intelligent transportation, smart grid, smart building, and mobile healthcare. However, security has become a key challenge for the wide deployment of IoT: because of the environmental influences, the IoT data are inherently noisy. Moreover, the IoT devices may be compromised by attackers to intentionally generate fake data. Finally, the underlying wireless network can also be subverted. To address the security issue in IoT, we propose a policy-based secure and trustworthy sensing scheme for IoT named RealAlert, in which the trustworthiness of both data and the IoT devices are evaluated based on both the reporting history and the context in which the data are collected using policy rules. Experimental results have shown that the RealAlert scheme can accurately assess the trust of the sensor nodes as well as data in IoT.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2720635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959573","Internet of Things (IoT);policy;security;smart city;trust","Security;Smart cities;Internet of Things;Sensors;Smart grids;Data collection;Context","","142","","28","IEEE","27 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve this problem, this work developed a prototype-guided PDA method with momentum weight for fault diagnosis. Specifically, to reduce the risk of ruling out the outlier by the output of a classifier or a discriminator, a classwise selectively source weighting strategy that follows the number of the target pseudo labels is proposed. The target instances’ pseudo labels, which are obtained by calculating the distance between the target instance and the source prototypes, are irrelevant to the classifier and discriminator. Furthermore, the momentum algorithm, by which the historical weights information could be retained, is employed in the source weights calculation procedure to alleviate the fluctuation and more closely to the global optimal.

Although the consumer IoT enables users to control many devices and offers conveniences and benefits for daily life, its long-term operation capabilities are subject to a bottleneck related to power management. To save energy and prolong the lifetime of an IoT system, the basic idea is to allow idle devices to go to sleep. Because excessively frequent switching between the awake and asleep phases will consume a significant amount of power, it is essential to properly schedule the order of multiple communication streams among multiple devices such that the total number of wake-up events is as small as possible. Based on the typical communication protocols deployed in IoT systems, this problem can be divided into two cases: 1) the inter-superframe case and the 2) intrasuperframe case. The former case has been well studied in existing works, whereas research on the latter case is currently immature. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme for addressing the stream order scheduling (SOS) problem in the intrasuperframe case. Mobile edge computing technology is utilized in the proposed scheme to reduce the network load, and three heuristic algorithms are proposed to improve the scheme's performance. We report various tests conducted on 4800 random original IoT topologies and 19000 random Hamiltonian edge-dual topologies, and the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves optimal solutions with a very high success probability.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2915793","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFB0800602); Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018CXGC0701); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672350); 111 Project(grant numbers:B08004); JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP19K20250); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710251","Edge computing;green Internet of Things (IoT);stream order scheduling (SOS)","Edge computing;Topology;Internet of Things;Power system management;Schedules;Performance evaluation;Heuristic algorithms","","5","","44","IEEE","9 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the vulnerability of IoT infrastructure under intentional attacks is investigated by relating the network resilience to the percolation-based connectivity. Intentional attacks impose severe threats on the network operations as it can effectively disrupt a network by paralyzing a small fraction of nodes, and therefore deteriorating IoT operations. A fusion-based defense mechanism is proposed to mitigate the damage caused by such attacks, where each node feedbacks minimum (one-bit) local decision to the fusion center for attack inference. By formulating the attack and defense strategy as a zero-sum game, the outcome of the game equilibrium is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. The robustness of the Internet-oriented and the cyber-physical system (CPS)-oriented networks are specifically analyzed to illustrate the foundation of future IoT infrastructure. Both analytical and empirical results show that the proposed mechanism greatly enhances the robustness of IoT, even in the weak local detection capability and fragile network structure regime.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2337018","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849970","Attack and defense;connectivity;cyber-physical system (CPS);machine-to-machine (M2M) communications;network vulnerability;zero-sum game","Robustness;Games;Resilience;Internet of Things;Game theory;Network topology","","68","","63","IEEE","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, various scenarios for vulnerability assessment of P2P energy exchanges considering adverse prosumers and consumers, who provide false information regarding the price and quantity with the goal of maximum financial benefit and system operation disruption, are considered. Techno-economic survivability analysis against these attacks are investigated on a IEEE 13-node unbalanced distribution test system. Simulation results demonstrate that adverse peers can affect the physical operation of grid, maximize their benefits, and cause financial loss of other agents.","","978-1-6654-6591-5","10.1109/KPEC54747.2022.9814773","Office of Energy Efficiency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9814773","Adverse Users;Cyber-Physical Resilience;Peer-to-Peer Energy Exchanges;Unbalanced Distribution Networks;Vulnerability Assessment","Simulation;Systems operation;Voltage;Peer-to-peer computing;Power systems;Internet of Things;Active distribution networks","","","","25","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When applied for encoding a task by considering the behaviour of the end-effector of a robotic manipulator in Cartesian space, the common solution is to represent and to encode the pose separately as position and orientation using different but phase-coupled DMP formulations; resulting mathematically and algorithmically inefficient. Dual Quaternions are a mathematical tool capable of representing pose in a unified variable.

Most of today,s machines, e.g., automotive engines, production machinery or even consumer devices, such as a washing machine, are controlled by an embedded computer system. It is assumed that the widespread integration of these existing embedded computer systems and data bases into systems-ofsystems (e.g., the Internet of Things, IoT) will provide new synergistic services, make better use of the available information, lead to new insights, improve current economic processes and thus create greater wealth. Fueled by the dramatic technological progress in the area of wire-bound and wire-less communication, this integration is already happening on a wide scale in industry. From the viewpoint of computer science, the domain of Systems-of-Systems (SoS) is a relatively new field that poses significant new research challenges. In our view, the differentiating characteristics of a SoS compared to a monolithic system are the autonomy of the Constituent Systems (CS), emergent phenomena at the SoS level, uncoordinated evolution of the CSs and most, importantly, that the occurrence of faults in the CSs must be considered normal during the operation an SoS. This presentation will focus on the issues that are posed by the integration of embedded systems into systems of systems and will refer to the research approach taken in the European AMADEOS project 610535 (Architecture for Multi-criticality Agile Dependable Evolutionary Open System-of-Systems).

Consequently, the needs of patients with chronic diseases are increasing and becoming more complex and multi-faceted; they require addressing not only the physical body, but also behavioral, emotional, and spiritual health. The current healthcare delivery system organically developed to address acute conditions, primarily injury and infection during the mid-19th century, a time when the body was viewed as a machine. This led to the organization of the healthcare delivery system by organ systems into specialties and departments. However, the healthcare delivery system today needs to provide healthcare services that span multiple systems to provide the care patients need. Such care requires services from multiple specialties (e.g., podiatry and endocrinology for diabetes, primary care and psychiatry for behavioral health, and palliative care MDs and chaplains & social workers for end-of-life care) that each effectively functions as its own system. There are currently several limitations and difficulties in designing patient-oriented healthcare services utilizing a system of systems framework. First, clinical models describe the service with a focus on resources. Second, the description tends to be at a high-level of abstraction, leaving the details to the implementer. Finally, the patient is generally modeled as an operand non-participatory agent, being pushed and pulled through the system. This paper describes the use of engineering and systems principles to design patient-oriented healthcare services that provide detail and quantification that classic services do not model. In doing so, these designed system of system models incorporate the detail, data quantification and implementation level information to allow for the success of the clinical aspect of the model to be achieved. This paper presents a medical based description of a system of systems and the engineered system based description of an integrated patient-oriented service.","","978-1-5386-4876-6","10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428716","","Modeling;Radio frequency;System of systems;Transportation;Personnel;Diseases","","6","","31","IEEE","9 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complex interconnected living environment is becoming a central focus for improvement given its strong influence on health in general and on how chronic conditions arise and persist. Such a strong focus on our community living environment has prompted various level regions (i.e. cities, districts) to take action in their communities. Stakeholders have turned to national data sources to inform a region of the many factors that describe it. However, these multiple factor datasets should be analyzed holistically as a system rather than individually. Consequently, this work develops a system of systems community typology from national data describing types of factor value combinations within a region.

These physical objects after getting connected to the Internet can provide smart services and are therefore known as smart objects. For the realization of IoT, it is necessary for the smart objects to discover and interact each other without human intervention. The number of smart objects connected to IoT are increasing at a rapid rate, creating an overhead for the users of controlling these many smart objects. One smart solution to this problem is the use of Context-Aware Communication. This work aims to propose Enhanced Context-Aware CoAP Extension for smart objects discovery in Internet of Things (IoT), namely ECTX-CoAP, which is enhancement of CoAP-CTX [2]. CoAP-CTX is able to do Context-Aware discovery of smart objects but at the cost of discovery response time. The enhancement to CoAP-CTX is made by first, reducing discovery response time, comparable to CoAP and second, by adding the concept of Group Communication functionality to it other than multi-casting. The proposed ECTX-CoAP is implemented in Contiki using Cooja simulator. The experimental results show that the proposed enhancement has successfully reduced the discovery time and number of messages exchanged, also allowing users to access a group of smart objects efficiently.","","978-1-5386-8215-9","10.1109/INFOCOMTECH.2018.8722425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8722425","Internet of Things;smart objects;discovery;CoAP;CoAP-CTX;Group Communication","Internet of Things;Protocols;Servers;Temperature sensors;Time factors","","","","9","IEEE","27 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Essentially, the training and testing data that are collected by massive IoT devices may contain noise (e.g., abnormal data, incorrect labels, and incomplete information) and adversarial examples. This requires high robustness of ML models to make reliable decisions for IoT applications. The research of robust ML has received tremendous attention from both academia and industry in recent years. This article will investigate the state of the art and representative works of robust ML models that can enable high resilience and reliability of IoT intelligence. Two aspects of robustness will be focused on, i.e., when the training data of ML models contain noises and adversarial examples, which may typically happen in many real-world IoT scenarios. In addition, the reliability of both neural networks and reinforcement learning framework will be investigated. Both of these two ML paradigms have been widely used in handling data in IoT scenarios.

With its decentralized and privacy preserving features, blockchain technology fits well into the scheme of things. This mitigates the quintessential challenges faced in most of the centralized systems. In this paper, we are focusing on the new firmware update scheme to perform the update operations securely. We propose a blockchain based solution for managing firmware updates in IoT. Improper management of devices and distribution of firmware updates from the device vendor could sabotage the IoT ecosystem. The objective of this proposed scheme is to verify and distribute the firmware binaries securely to the IoT device deployed by the device vendor. The PUSH-based method is used for a firmware update in which verification of firmware is done by Hash Chain.

This article aims to improve the resiliency of cyber-physical power grids to such attacks. Specifically, we use an epidemic model to understand the dynamic botnet formation, which facilitates the assessment of the cyber layer vulnerability of the grid. The attacker aims to exploit this vulnerability to enable a successful physical compromise, while the system operator’s goal is to ensure a normal operation of the grid by mitigating cyber risks. We develop a cross-layer game-theoretic framework for strategic decision-making to enhance cyber-physical grid resiliency. The cyber-layer game guides the system operator on how to defend against the botnet attacker as the first layer of defense, while the dynamic game strategy at the physical layer further counteracts the adversarial behavior in real time for improved physical resilience.

The exponential rise in IoT implementation starts to affect human-to-human communication recently. Furthermore, it is hard to achieve a secure transmission as the microprocessor-based IoT nodes do not have enough computing power. Edge computing in IoT (edge-IoT) promises low bandwidth and secure transmission. Edge-IoT is the ability of a node to perform high computation before sending its data. Thus, instead of sending raw data, an edge node is sending a post-processed the data with much lower bandwidth. An edge-IoT node also can perform a complex encryption computation before the transmission to secure the data. This paper proposes an edge-IoT using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) as an IoT node.

Device authentication and data security is a major concern in IoT networks as the devices used in these networks have inadequate computational processing and memory storage resources. Privacy is of paramount importance in applications such as healthcare and finance. As complex algorithms cannot be implemented on the resource-constrained IoT devices, research in the aforementioned areas is still an active subject. In this paper, we propose a mutual device and server authentication protocol using Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for IoT devices. PUFs can be used to uniquely identify the devices and can also be used to generate random keys. As the name suggests, the keys generated by the PUFs cannot be reproduced. Using this unclonability feature, an authentication protocol has been developed. An IoT based temperature and humidity sensing module is developed to integrate the protocol and validate its effectiveness in providing the device authentication and data security.","","978-1-7281-9180-5","10.1109/ICCCS49678.2020.9276868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9276868","authentication;internet of things;physical unclonable functions;security;trust-worthy","Authentication;Protocols;Internet of Things;Servers;Physical unclonable function;Security;Databases","","5","","19","IEEE","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, in real time applications that time is of the essence, this delay should be small. The period of time from when an IoT device initiates a Random Access (RA) process to get access to the network until it sends its data is called the latency. Since the latency is dependent on the number of IoT devices in the network, the way that each device generates its traffic, and many other factors, it is extremely challenging to accurately estimate the latency. In this paper, we provide a simplistic view to estimate the latency in various situations based on the number of collisions, repetition, and data size for various RA processes belonging to different Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) technology enhancements. To simplify the situation, we only discuss the most important factors. This simplistic view gives the reader a sense of the trimming of different parts of the RA process without using a complex simulator or analytical model.","2644-3163","978-1-7281-8416-6","10.1109/IEMCON51383.2020.9284948","British Columbia Institute of Technology research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284948","Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT);Random Access;Early data transmission;Preconfigured Uplink Resources","Mobile communication;Real-time systems;Delays;Internet of Things;3GPP;Uplink;Information technology","","4","","13","IEEE","22 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consensus mechanisms represents the rule set imposed by the blockchain network on the IoT devices to enhance network security. In this paper, we analyzed three types of consensus mechanisms - Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Authority - to determine which is best suited for use in IoT data storage solution that uses blockchain. Thus, we evaluated the consensus mechanisms on public blockchain test networks using three metrics: transaction latency, average block time, and average query time. Our obtained results show the PoS and PoA consensus mechanisms are more appropriate for IoT, exhibiting lower transaction latency, lower average block time and query time when compared to the PoW mechanism. This suggests that PoS and PoA are promising alternatives for blockchain-based IoT systems that require energy-efficient and low-latency transactions.","2159-3604","979-8-3503-3193-6","10.1109/ATEE58038.2023.10108211","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10108211","Blockchain;Consensus mechanisms;Internet of Things;Blockchain Testnets;Proof of Stake;Proof of Authority;Proof of Work","Performance evaluation;Memory;Computer architecture;Network security;Proof of Work;Consensus protocol;Internet of Things","","3","","25","IEEE","28 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies indicate that most of the existing IoT devices have inherent security flaws and are vulnerable to both internal and external attacks. Threat identification is generally done by either identification of the specific type of attack in the network or by distinguishing benign traffic from anomalous traffic. Most of the recent works for threat identification rely on supervised machine learning techniques which involve training a model using datasets containing labeled samples of prior attacks. A supervised network can thus only understand the categories on which it has been trained. Due to the enormous volume and variety of data collected by the IoT devices, and the attacks to which the networks are prone, the supervised techniques are of limited use in practical applications. We propose a novel threat identification strategy using the Clustering based Variational Autoencoder (CVA) for detecting threats (anomalous behaviors) in IoT networks. The proposed strategy uses an unsupervised technique and hence the model needs to be trained only on traffic under benign scenarios for the identification of threats. Also, the proposed technique is scalable to accommodate a large number of devices.","2325-9418","978-1-6654-7350-7","10.1109/INDICON56171.2022.10039898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039898","Anomaly detection;Variational Autoencoder;Threat Intelligence;Internet of Things;Unsupervised learning","Training;Machine learning;Data models;Behavioral sciences;Internet of Things;Security;Unsupervised learning","","1","","14","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A successful platform must balance sufficient commonality to support economical reuse, while also providing variability and extensibility to enable innovation in system and system of systems (SoS) capabilities. These commonality/variability tradeoffs for SoS platforms are frequently tacit decisions, since there are no accepted techniques for analyzing such decisions at the scale and degree of requirements uncertainty that characterize most SoSs. The objective of our work is to develop a method for analyzing decisions about requirements for common platforms for SoSs. The method begins with the requirements tasks of identifying and selecting appropriate variabilities (variation points, variation ranges, and variation decision binding times) to support immediate SoS needs, and also enable innovation and controlled evolution. We are currently conducting a workshop and interviews with SoS experts to define the essential technical problems in SoS common platform development and identify solution constraints. We will then define a simplified SoS with limited capability requirements to use as a model problem. We will use the model problem to assess the fit of existing scope, commonality, and variability methods from software product lines to the SoS context, and extend existing economic models using real options and probabilistic models to model uncertainty in evolution requirements. While it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of our approach, it is based on proven technologies from the mature field of software product lines and so we have confidence that we can build successful SoS techniques from this foundation.","","978-1-4673-4379-4","10.1109/RES4.2012.6347693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6347693","system of systems;software requirements;platform engineering;software product lines;system of systems architecture","Software;Economics;Computer architecture;Context;Conferences;Context modeling","","3","","10","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we compare a theoretical model found in literature with the results of this real-life setup. Our measurements indicate a less optimistic power profile than proposed in the theoretical model.

In this context, CPS design should take both security and resilience requirements into account, by identifying the needed measures not only to prevent but also to withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions and attacks. The approach proposed in this article aims at improving the security and resilience of a CPS deployment through a model-based design methodology leveraging security-by-design principles and Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques, consisting in continually shifting a system configuration to reduce the attack success probability and survive attacks.

IoT systems require good quality sensor data in order to make real-time decisions. However, values are often missing from the sensor data collected owing to faulty sensors, a loss of data during communication, interference, and measurement errors. Considering the spatiotemporal nature of IoT data and the uncertainty of the data collected by sensors, we propose a new framework with which to impute missing values utilizing Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) as a convenient means to estimate the missing data from IoT applications. Missing sensor measurements adversely affect the quality of data, and consequently the performance and outcomes of IoT systems. Our proposed framework incorporates BME in order to impute missing values in diverse IoT scenarios by making use of the combination of low- and high-precision sensors. Our approach can incorporate the measurement errors of low-precision sensors as interval quantities along with the high-precision sensor measurements, making it highly suitable for real-time IoT systems. Our framework is robust to variations in data, requires less execution time, and requires only a single input parameter, thus outperforming existing IoT data imputation methods. The experimental results obtained for three IoT data sets demonstrate the superiority of the BME framework as regards accuracy, running time, and robustness. The framework can additionally be extended to distributed IoT nodes for the online imputation of missing values.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2987979","Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the PERSEIDES Project(grant numbers:TIN2017-86885-R); European Commission through the H2020 IoTCrawler(grant numbers:779852); DEMETER under Agreement 857202 EU Projects; European Social Fund and Youth European Initiative through the Spanish Seneca Foundation; Australian Research Council Discovery Project(grant numbers:DP190102828); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066992","Bayesian maximum entropy (BME);Internet of Things (IoT);imputation;missing data;spatiotemporal analysis","Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Robustness;Correlation;Actuators","","27","","55","IEEE","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to scale up the applications with assured security becomes a critical challenge. Blockchain technology (BCT) is a promising solution to provide security and protect privacy in a large scale; especially, smart contracts offer opportunities to improve the reliability of IoT applications.

Recently, many literature surveys and positioning articles have been published on the integration of BCT with IoT, but they are limited to superficial discussions of technical potentials, and very few of them have a thorough exploration of the challenges in developing BCT for IoT at technical levels. This paper uses the system design approach to scrutinize the state of the art of study on BCT-based applications and clarify critical research areas of enabling BCT for security assurance: 1) the relations of BCT and IoT are modeled and discussed; 2) the needs of eliminating threats in IoT-based applications are defined as functional requirements (FRs), existing works on enabling technologies of BCT are defined as the physical solutions (PSs); and 3) the mappings between FRs and PSs are established to identify the limitations and the critical areas for the applications of BCT in large-scale distributed environment.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2925825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8752029","Axiomatic design theory (ADT);blockchain technologies (BCT);Internet of Things (IoT);literature review;security assurance;service-oriented architecture (SoA);smart contract","Internet of Things;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Computer crime;System analysis and design;Privacy","","118","1","80","IEEE","1 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the main issues is increasing the efficiency of use-limited resources (time, energy, radio frequency spectrum) by the Internet of things devices. Besides, there is a lack of guaranteeing trustworthy, user/data security and resistance against adversaries there. In this regard, trustworthiness evaluation and a coherent recommendation of estimating friend nodes' reliability will allow achieving network security and isolating malicious nodes' environment.

This requires an authentic key exchange between two communicating entities, which in turn needs a mutual authentication of the entities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach supplying zero-knowledge and identity-based authentication with integrated key exchange while meeting the IoT challenges. Our approach is resistant to active man in the middle attacks and does not include any costly cryptographic operations. Also, it does not require any predistribution or pre-sharing with regard to authenticating entities. Additionally, our identity-based scheme allows that a thing can operate autonomously in a secure manner.

This paper presents a methodology to determine utilization of FM radio spectrum, which would support efficient IoT device communication via CR. The methodology is showcased by analyzing the FM radio spectrum in an urban area and determining its capacity to support IoT device communication.

Thus, implementing and analyzing HE schemes and protocols on resource-constrained devices is essential to deriving optimized and secure schemes. This paper develops an energy profiling framework for homomorphic encryption on IoT devices. In particular, we analyze energy consumption and performance such as CPU and Memory utilization and execution time of numerous HE schemes using SEAL and HElib libraries on the Raspberry Pi 4 hardware platform and study energy-performance-security trade-offs. Our analysis reveals that HE schemes can incur a maximum of 70.07% in terms of energy consumption among the libraries. Finally, we provide guidelines for optimization of Homomorphic Encryption by leveraging multi-threading and edge computing capabilities for IoT applications.

TSCH is now the basis of a full stack for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) proposed by the International Engineering Task Force (IETF), known as 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e).

Exogenous resilience is the permanent capability of the system to maintain a safe operation within its ambient environment. In this paper, we present a predictive dual-sided contract-based formal methodology to address both aspects of resilience on top of a distributed object-oriented component-based software model. It is illustrated by a case study of urban drone rescue systems. We exploit the formalism of timed automat a and the toolbox UPPAAL to predict by abstraction and analyze (simulate and verify) endogenous resilience. Instead of presenting the final models of the case study, we reflect our experience with UPPAAL in generic patterns of system design and contract specification, reusable in other contexts with adaptations. The analysis of exogenous resilience is specific to the considered drone rescue system. It consists of synthesizing by iterative model-checking safe flight paths for the drones within a 3D virtual model of urban surroundings true to modern cities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2903153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668400","Resilience;safety;distributed control;object-oriented software;component-based architectures;design by contracts;timed automata;3D models;model-checking;temporal logic;fairness","Resilience;Drones;Object oriented modeling;Software;Safety;Computational modeling;Analytical models","","18","","54","OAPA","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If the collected data is corrupted, the performance of the back-end decision support can degrade. This research outlines a novel method for estimating the trustworthiness of data in an IoT network. The proposed ensemble-based method estimates a trust score for each data point generated by a sensor using models that assess both its consistency with other sensors within the network and its history of producing data consistent with the widespread network. One key advantage of the proposed ensemble method is its robustness to corruption from multiple sensors within the network. Numerical experiments are performed on a smart-home data set and demonstrate the ability for the proposed method to 1) identify corrupted data and 2) produce estimates of the data that are robust to simultaneous corruption in multiple sensors.","","978-1-7281-5503-6","10.1109/WF-IoT48130.2020.9221203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9221203","","Data models;Robustness;Numerical models;Internet of Things;History;Testing","","2","","19","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Timed automata are a formal model that describes system behaviors and properties using mathematics-based logic languages with precision. Due to the semantics that are used in developing the formal models, verification techniques, such as theorem proving and model checking, are used to mathematically prove the specifications and security properties of the CPS.

Owing to the severity of these threats, a variety of security techniques are available. However, no single technique can address the whole spectrum of cyber-attacks that may be launched by a determined and resourceful attacker. In light of this, we consider a multi-pronged approach for designing secure and resilient IIoT systems, which integrates redundancy, diversity, and hardening techniques. We introduce a framework for quantifying cyber-security risks and optimizing IIoT design by determining security investments in redundancy, diversity, and hardening.

Unfortunately, the growing multiple tasks from users are occuring with the emergence of the IoT environment. Meanwhile, the current computation offloading with QoE is solved by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the issue of instability and slow convergence. Therefore, improving the QoE in edge-enabled IoT is still the ultimate challenge. In this article, to enhance the QoE, we propose a new QoE model to study the computation offloading. Specifically, the emerged QoE model can capture three influential elements: 1) service latency determined by local computing latency and transmission latency; 2) energy consumption according to local calculation and transmission consumption; and 3) task success rate based on the coding error probability. Moreover, we improve the deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) algorithm and propose a algorithm named the double-dueling-deterministic policy gradients (D3PG) based on the proposed model. Specifically, the actor network highly relies on the critic network, which makes the performance of the DDPG sensitive to the critic and thus leads to poor stability and slow convergence in the computation offloading process. To solve this, we redesign the critic network by using Double Q -learning and Dueling networks. Extensive experiments verify the better stability and faster convergence of our proposed algorithm than existing methods. In addition, experiments also indicate that our proposed algorithm can improve the QoE performance.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2981557","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872195,61772286); “333” Project of Jiangsu Province, China(grant numbers:BRA2017401); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9039641","Computation offloading;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);edge;Internet of Things (IoT);Quality of Experience (QoE)","Quality of experience;Task analysis;Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Servers;Convergence;Energy consumption","","137","","40","IEEE","17 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the rapid deployment of cameras, tasks in IoT like visual information are more important, but IoT devices have limited computing resources, including power, computing ability, storage, etc. Some tasks that might be perfectly normal to perform on a computer would be rather challenging on an IoT device. Therefore, how to maintain acceptable performance while minimizing resources is becoming a more consequential part in IoT. In this article, we aim to solve the problem of object detection and tracking in IoT while minimizing resources. The traditional algorithms need to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify different objects in each frame, and then determine the tracking target from identified objects, which typically requires a lot of computing resources. By incorporating spatial attention, and multidomain network, we proposed a novel algorithm named as spatial attention powered multidomain network (SA-MDNet). By adding the spatial attention mechanism to the original MDNet model, and using multiclass cross-entropy loss, we are able to distinguish the background and the target in different video sequences effectively and efficiently. This novel algorithm achieves similar performance on the OTB 50/100/2013 data sets compared to several state-of-art models, while uses only a fraction of the memory compared to MDNet.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3099855","Science and Technology Planning Project in Henan Province(grant numbers:212102210326); Key Research Projects of Henan Higher Schools(grant numbers:21B460007); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51975428,51975426); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9495931","Internet of Things (IoT);multidomain network;object detection;object tracking;spatial attention","Target tracking;Internet of Things;Task analysis;Convolution;Target recognition;Visualization;Learning systems","","11","","29","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the major problems in the path to intelligent IoT is understanding “context,” or making sense of the environment, situation, or status using data from sensors, and then acting accordingly in autonomous ways. This is called “context-aware computing,” and it now requires both sensing and, increasingly, learning, as IoT systems get more data and better learning from this big data. In this survey, we review the field, first, from a historical perspective, covering ubiquitous and pervasive computing, ambient intelligence, and wireless sensor networks, and then, move to context-aware computing studies.

Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to IoT devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like IoT applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare.

The explosive growth of mobile users and IoT applications injects massive traffic to the IoT network and also speeds up the drainage of sensor batteries. Caching at the IoT gateway (GW), which stores the IoT data and directly send them to the users, can avoid activating sensors too frequently, hence reducing the traffic in the IoT network as well as the energy consumption of sensors. To overcome the limited energy capacity of sensors, energy transmitters (ETs) are deployed to charge them. Practically, the GW and ETs may be owned by different operators, and the GW operator needs to incentivize ETs to provision the charging service. In this paper, we formulate a Stackelberg game in the cache-enabled energy harvesting aided IoT framework to improve the user quality of service. Caching strategies, incentive strategies, and ET transmission power strategies are jointly optimized to find the Stackelberg equilibrium by our proposed alternative direction approach.

In such a connected environment, the social IoT (SIoT) has become an emerging trend where multiple IoT devices owned by users support communication within a social circle. Trust management in the SIoT network is imperative as trusting the information from compromised devices could lead to serious compromises within the network. It is important to have a mechanism where the devices and their users evaluate the trustworthiness of other devices and users before trusting the information sent by them. The privacy preservation, decentralization, and self-enforcing management without involving trusted third parties are the fundamental challenges in designing a trust management system for SIoT. To fulfill these challenges, this article presents a novel framework for computing and updating the trustworthiness of participants in the SIoT network in a self-enforcing manner without relying on any trusted third party. The privacy of the participants in the SIoT is protected by using homomorphic encryption in the decentralized setting. To achieve the properties of self-enforcement, the trust score of each device is automatically updated based on its previous trust score and the up-to-date tally of the votes by its peers in the network with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enforce that every participant follows the protocol honestly. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and present evaluation benchmarks by prototyping the main functionality of the system. The performance results show that the system has a linear increase in computation and communication overheads with more participants in the network. Furthermore, we prove the correctness, privacy, and security of the proposed system under a malicious adversarial model.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2962282","European Research Council (ERC)(grant numbers:306994); Royal Society(grant numbers:ICA/R1/180226); ERC Proof of Concept(grant numbers:677124); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949450","Privacy-preserving aggregation;secure multiparty computation (SMC);self-enforcing trust aggregation;social Internet of Things (SIoT)","Privacy;Trust management;Internet of Things;Protocols;Data privacy;Cryptography","","62","","70","IEEE","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It extends connectivity to everyday things, however, such increase in the connectivity creates many prominent challenges. Context: Generally, IoT opens the door for new applications for machine-to-machine and human-to-human communications. The current trend of collaborating, distributed teams through the Internet, mobile communications, and autonomous entities, e.g., robots, is the first phase of the IoT to develop and deliver diverse services and applications. However, such collaborations is threatened by the fragmentation that we witness in the industry nowadays as it brings difficulty to integrate the diverse technologies of the various objects found in IoT systems. Diverse technologies induce interoperability issues while designing and developing various services and applications, hence, limiting the possibility of reusing the data, more specifically, the software (including frameworks, firmware, applications programming interfaces, and user interfaces) as well as of facing issues, like security threats and bugs, when developing new services or applications. Different aspects of handling data collection ranging from discovering smart sensors for data collection, integrating and applying reasoning on them must be available to provide interoperability and flexibility to the diverse objects interacting in the system. However, such approaches are bound to be challenged in future IoT scenarios as they bring substantial performance impairments in settings with the very large number of collaborating devices and technologies. Objective: We raise the awareness of the community about the lack of interoperability among technologies developed for IoT and challenges that their integration poses. We also provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners interested in connecting IoT networks and devices to develop services and applications. Method: We apply the methods advocated by the evidence-based software engineering paradigm. This paradigm and its core tool, the systematic literature review (SLR), were introduced to the software-engineering research community early 2004 to help researchers and industry systematically and objectively gather and aggregate evidences about different topics. In this paper, we conduct an SLR of both IoT interoperability issues and the state-of-practice of IoT technologies in the industry, highlighting the integration challenges related to the IoT that have significantly shifted the landscape of Internet-based collaborative services and applications nowadays. Results: Our SLR identifies a number of studies from journals, conferences, and workshops with the highest quality in the field. This SLR reports different trends, including frameworks and technologies, for the IoT for better comprehension of the paradigm and discusses the integration and interoperability challenges across the different layers of this technology while shedding light on the current IoT state-of-practice.

Many architectural limitations, such as weak security, data distribution efficiency, provenance and traceability of sources, excessive human intervention, lack of interoperability, and service-awareness in devices configuration, have been exposed and called the society attention. This paper addresses these limitations by properly integrating five strategies: 1) efficient IoT data exchanging, storage and processing via information-centric networking (ICN); 2) contract-based IoT services composition; 3) software-control/management of IoT devices accordingly to the services requirements; 4) naming and name resolution of the physical and virtual entities, proving identifier/locator splitting and contextualized self-organization; and 5) name-based routing and network caching. Considering the current state-of-the art, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: proposal of a novel service-defined architecture (SDA), in which device configurations are a reflex of the real service needs (given by established contracts); combination of ICN benefits with named-services; and perennial identification of IoT devices, services, and data using self-verifiable naming. All integration work has been supported by a convergent architecture called NovaGenesis (NG), demonstrating its viability as an alternative for the current IoT architectures. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented in laboratory under real conditions. The experimental results indicate competitive performance in terms of data transfer, memory and CPU consumption.

The impact of this revolution is clearly seen in our homes where appliances are controlled and managed via voice commands, inspiration, hand signals, or by a command that results from analyzing the human behavior. Power conservation is one of the significant issues in smart homes and smart cities where buildings consume about 40% of the total energy. Another crucial issue is the user satisfaction. Achieving a balance between power conservation and the user satisfaction is a challenge. In this article, our contributions are: 1) a survey that sheds light on various techniques (the state of the art) used for reducing the power consumption based on monitoring the occupant's behavior; 2) a comparison between these techniques based on various factors elicited from the literature review; and 3) this study reveals the following gaps in the previous work: a) lack of integrity between the IoT systems; b) lack of auto measuring of the user satisfaction; and c) lack of achieving a balance between the user satisfaction and the power saving.

By leveraging cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), real-time status data are collected and processed to perform decision making and optimization. Hybrid automata is used to model the dynamic behavior of physical manufacturing resources, such as machines and vehicles in shop floors. Three levels of collaborative control granularity, including nodal SCC, local SCC, and global SCC, are introduced to address different degrees of exceptions. Collaborative optimization problems are solved using analytical target cascading (ATC). A proof of concept simulation based on a Chinese aero-engine manufacturer validates the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method, showing reductions in waiting time, makespan, and energy consumption with reasonable computational time.

Consequently, trustworthy data act as fuel for applications that rely on the data generated by these things, for critical decision-making processes, data debugging, risk assessment, forensic analysis, and performance tuning. Currently, secure and reliable data communication in IoT is based on public-key cryptosystems such as the elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC). Nevertheless, the reliance on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by the impending quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical primitives to quantum-safe primitives is indispensable to ensure the overall security of data en route. In this article, we investigate applications of one of the postquantum signatures called hash-based signature (HBS) schemes for the security of IoT devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the evolution of HBS schemes with an emphasis on their construction parameters and associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline the striking features of HBS schemes and their significance for IoT security in the quantum era. We also investigate the optimal selection of HBS in the IoT networks with respect to their performance-constrained requirements, resource-constrained nature, and design optimization objectives. In addition to ongoing standardization efforts, we also highlight current and future research and deployment challenges along with possible solutions.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multi-layer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ""edge router"" incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.","","978-1-5386-7244-0","10.1109/ICIOT.2018.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8473435","6LoWPAN;AWS IOT;Internet of Things","Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Hardware;Cryptography;Open source software;Real-time systems","","2","","19","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is highly necessary to find the probable reasons for traffic congestion in a traffic domain in order to minimize the hours wasted on the streets. Existing centralized approach to monitor this traffic domain eventually minimizes the outcome in terms of cost, time and scalability issue. By integrating social networking concepts into Internet of Things a new paradigm has been proposed named Social Internet of Things (SIoT). In this paper, we have approached to convert a traffic domain into a complex network that integrates Social Internet of Things (SIoT) concept in that traffic domain in a distributive manner by assuming each vehicle as an IoT device. The underneath concept is that every vehicle will communicate with other vehicles using its friendship in a decentralized manner with only local information. In the complex network of such smart IoT devices, by performing experiments on network properties and analyzing the result traffic congestion and probable reason behind traffic congestion has been predicted.","","978-1-5386-5163-6","10.1109/ICIEV.2018.8640955","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8640955","social Internet of things (SIoT);IoT device;centralized;decentralized;distributive","Automobiles;Internet of Things;Social networking (online);Complex networks;Color;Topology","","1","","19","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All the single-antenna IoT devices in each cluster cooperate with each other to establish a virtual MIMO entity, and multiple independent data streams are requested by each cluster. NOMA is employed to superimpose all the requested data streams, and each cluster leverages zero-forcing detection to demultiplex the input data streams. Only statistical channel state information (CSI) is available at the base station to avoid the waste of the energy and bandwidth on frequent CSI estimations. The outage probability and goodput of the virtual MIMO-NOMA system are thoroughly investigated by considering the Kronecker model, which embraces both the transmit and receive correlations. Furthermore, the asymptotic results facilitate not only the exploration of physical insights but also the goodput maximization. In particular, the asymptotic outage expressions provide quantitative impacts of various system parameters and enable the investigation of diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). Moreover, power allocation coefficients and/or transmission rates can be properly chosen to achieve the maximal goodput. By favor of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, the goodput maximization problems can be solved in closed form, with which the joint power and rate selection is realized by using alternately iterating optimization. Besides, the optimization algorithms tend to allocate more power to clusters under unfavorable channel conditions and support clusters with a higher transmission rate under benign channel conditions.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2957209","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFE0120600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801192,61801246,61601524); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019A1515012136); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114002,2019B010137006); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau, China(grant numbers:0036/2019/A1,037/2017/AMJ,SKL-IOTSC2018-2020); Open Research Foundation of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory of Southeast University(grant numbers:2018D09); Research Committee of University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00156-FST,MYRG2016-00171-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920088","Internet of Things (IoT);Kronecker model;nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA);virtual multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);zero forcing (ZF)","NOMA;MIMO communication;Internet of Things;Power system reliability;Probability;Correlation;Downlink","","34","","75","IEEE","3 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These applications and networks are subject to continuous change. The current separation of design process and operation in the field will be superseded by a life-long design process of adaptation, infield integration, and update. Continuous change and evolution, application interference, environment dynamics and uncertainty lead to complex effects which must be controlled to serve a growing set of platform and application needs. Self-adaptation based on self-awareness and self-configuration has been proposed as a basis for such a continuous in-field process. Research is needed to develop automated in-field design methods and tools with the required safety, availability, and security guarantees. The paper shows two complementary use cases of self-awareness in architectures, methods, and tools for cyber-physical systems. The first use case focuses on safety and availability guarantees in self-aware vehicle platforms. It combines contracting mechanisms, tool based self-analysis and self-configuration. A software architecture and a runtime environment executing these tools and mechanisms autonomously are presented including aspects of self-protection against failures and security threats. The second use case addresses variability and long term evolution in networked MPSoC integrating hardware and software mechanisms of surveillance, monitoring, and continuous adaptation. The approach resembles the logistics and operation principles of manufacturing plants which gave rise to the metaphoric term of an Information Processing Factory that relies on incremental changes and feedback control. Both use cases are investigated by larger research groups. Despite their different approaches, both use cases face similar design and design automation challenges which will be summarized in the end. We will argue that seemingly unrelated research challenges, such as in machine learning and security, could also profit from the methods and superior modeling capabilities of self-aware systems.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2018.2858023","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:FOR1800,ER168/32-1,HE4584/7-1); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1704859); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466995","Cyber-physical systems;design automation;embedded systems;self-awareness","Cyber-physical systems;Safety;Computer security;Design automation;Embedded systems;Surveillance","","22","","80","CCBY","17 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These things can actively collect, analyze, and exchange data with other things or systems connected to the Internet. Furthermore, these things can take useful actions through activating actuators that are attached to them (or at least situated close by). As IoT systems become popular in various domains and applications today, we can see rich resources on these systems available in the literature. Such literature motivates the efforts to develop courses on IoT for students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. However, a major challenge occurs in approaching a course that is supposed to compile topics tackling various, and diverse, technologies in a unified material for university students. In this paper, we draw on the experiences gained from teaching the Introduction to the Internet of Things course for three consecutive semesters at the American University of Kuwait.

In this article, we consider a multiuser single-destination Internet of Things (IoT) system with periodic state updating, and investigate the scheduling methods of minimizing the long-term average AoI with limited retransmission times. In view of the retransmission mode, the AoI optimization problems for retransmission with and without feedback are analyzed. For the retransmission without feedback, we formulate the expected decision loss (EDL) function of the AoI optimization problem with the finite retransmission times and propose a loss-greedy policy by minimizing the EDL at each step. For the retransmission with feedback, a potential optimal solution is to construct the AoI optimization problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and solve the corresponding Bellman optimal equations. However, this optimal solution is prone to suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is hard to implement. To address this issue, we decouple the infinite-horizon MDP into the finite-state MDP in each single frame, and then propose a low-complexity slot-based max-weight (SBMW) policy to minimize the long-term average AoI. Numerical results show that, compared with an ALOHA-like baseline policy, the proposed Loss-Greedy policy can achieve up to 48% reduction of the average AoI for the retransmission without feedback, while the SBMW policy can reduce the average AoI by 57% in the retransmission with feedback.

With the integration of communication networks and high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs), modern power systems have evolved into a cross-domain multilayer complex system of systems with improved efficiency, controllability, and sustainability. However, increasing numbers of unexpected events, including natural disasters, extreme weather, and cyberattacks, are compromising the functionality of modern power systems and causing tremendous societal and economic losses. Resilience, a desirable property, is needed in modern power systems to ensure their capability to withstand all kinds of hazards while maintaining their functions. This article presents a systematic review of recent power system resilience enhancement techniques and proposes new directions for enhancing modern power systems’ resilience considering their cross-domain multilayer features. We first answer the question, “what is power system resilience?” from the perspectives of its definition, constituents, and categorization. It is important to recognize that power system resilience depends on two interdependent factors: network design and system operation. Following that, we present a review of articles published since 2016 that have developed innovative methodologies to improve power system resilience and categorize them into infrastructural resilience enhancement and operational resilience enhancement. We discuss their problem formulations and proposed quantifiable resilience measures, as well as point out their merits and limitations.

To meet these challenges many are looking to industry 4.0 technology as a solution, specifically the combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in-field robotics. Although there have been successful prototypes from a functional perspective and promising start-ups, the complex nature of the agriculture system of systems creates a significant risk of mass adoption failure. The main risk stems from the majority of the hundreds of products being designed in isolation using closed hardware and software systems that are all aiming to serve the one farmer or grower. The current silo’d technology adoption approach is heading towards problems with usability, availability, viability, interoperability and adaptability. This paper proposes a new time constrained System of Systems (SoS) discovery process and supporting SoS Canvas, developed with the objective of increasing the adoption of SoS principles with non-technical stakeholders. The time constrained SoS discovery process consists of raising awareness, capturing data, modelling the SoS, modelling the System of Interest (SoI) and providing recommendations, often based on common challenges and opportunities from the SoS Canvas. The outcome of this initial case study prototyping the process, is a set of SysML diagrams demonstrating how the constituent systems currently contribute to emergent properties and recommendations to improve both the SoI and the SoS.

In the other hand, the bond-graph is an excellent model dealing with microscopic level, it is however not suited for the higher levels where there is no power exchange. So, for the purpose of unifying the graphical methodologies describing System SoS abstraction levels, Some transformation rules, which consist in converting the bond-graph to a hyper-graph microscopic model are presented in this paper. Finally, The proposed transformation rules are illustrated through a pedagogical example taken from industrial application.","","978-1-5090-2188-8","10.1109/CoDIT.2016.7593555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7593555","System of Systems (SoS);macroscopic modelling;microscopic modelling;Hyper-graph model;Bond-graph model","Microscopy;Junctions;System of systems;Mathematical model;Boilers;Computational modeling;Generators","","","","20","IEEE","20 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, State Grid has deployed the Huawei IoT management platform to realize the standardized collection of data. However, the current IOTs management platform only realizes the access of MQTT protocol, and lacks the unified management capability for multi-source heterogeneous terminals. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel architecture design of power IoTs architecture. Focusing on the southbound device access and northbound device management of the IoTs management platform, a protocol analysis cloud gateway and a unified cloud edge collaboration architecture are proposed. In order to solve the problem of multi-protocol access, the protocol analysis cloud gateway deploys the parsing program in the form of plug-in in the protocol plug-in layer, which can be flexibly extended for new protocols. Aiming at the problem of device management, this paper proposes a unified cloud edge collaboration architecture, enhances the capabilities of remote management for application and container based on the northbound API interface of Huawei IoTs management platform, and proposes a method compatible with different edge computing frameworks on the edge side. At the same time, an experimental prototype system is built to realize the unified access to Q/GDW 1376, DL/T 698, IEC 101/104 and other types of protocol equipment, as well as the remote management of heterogeneous manufacturers' equipment.","","979-8-3503-4715-9","10.1109/EI256261.2022.10117281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10117281","power IoT;cloud-edge collaboration;Edge IOT agent","Cloud computing;Protocols;Collaboration;Prototypes;Computer architecture;System integration;Logic gates","","1","","10","IEEE","10 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the forensic perspective, the IoT environment contains a rich set of artifacts that could benefit investigations, while the forensic investigation in IoT paradigm may have to alter to accommodate characteristics of IoT. Therefore, in this article, we analyze the impact of IoT on digital forensics and systematize the research efforts made by previous researchers from 2010 to 2018. We sketch the landscape of IoT forensics and examine the state of IoT forensics under a 3-D framework. The 3-D framework consists of a temporal dimension, a spatial dimension, and a technical dimension. The temporal dimension walks through the standard digital forensic process while the spatial dimension explores where to identify sources of evidence in IoT environment. These two dimensions attempt to provide principles and guidelines for standardizing digital investigations in the context of IoT. The technical dimension guides a way to the exploration of tools and techniques to ensure the enforcement of digital forensics in the ever-evolving IoT environment.

In this paper, devices autonomously initiate their identity-creation processes. Each device generates a cryptographic key pair comprising a public key for openly identifying the device and a closely guarded private key used for authentication and decryption purposes. The research also introduces an innovative authentication algorithm within CPS environments that employs secure tokens to validate the authenticity of devices. The proposed framework reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches while empowering devices with control over their identities.

This paper summarizes and analyzes the connotation of networking information-centric system and technical system, and describes the general framework of networking information-centric system technical system verification, including verification process, verification technology and optimization decision technology.","2771-7372","978-1-6654-8456-5","10.1109/ICUS55513.2022.9986559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9986559","networking information-centric system of systems;technical system;verification","System verification;Information services;Communication networks;Optimization;System of systems","","","","13","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Software architecture of self-organizing systems-of-systems for the Internet-of-Things with SosADL","F. Oquendo","IRISA - UMR CNRS, Univ.

Indeed, on the one hand, at design-time, most often we do not know which are the concrete IoT systems that will become constituents of the SoS, these being predominantly identified at run-time; on the other hand, the correct architecture depends not only on the constituent systems but also, largely, on the operational environment where the SoS will be deployed. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the notion of self-organization, whose mechanism makes possible that the IoT constituent systems themselves create and maintain a valid architecture enabling the production of the required emergent behavior to fulfil the SoS mission. In particular, it describes how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), based on the novel π-Calculus for SoS, supports the architectural description of self-organizing SoSs for the IoT, upwardly causing SoS emergent behaviors at run-time.","","978-1-5090-5945-4","10.1109/SYSOSE.2017.7994959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7994959","Internet-of-Things;Self-Organization;Emergence;Software Architecture;System-of-Systems","Organizations;Chaos;Computer architecture;Standards organizations;Chemistry;Entropy;Liquids","","12","","39","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider both single-layer and multilayer network representations of SoS and focus on algebraic connectivity, inverse average path length, and largest connected component size as measures of robustness. Two case studies are used to illustrate our framework and assess its utility: a command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) simulation and a multilayer message-passing network simulation. We find that most of the considered network metrics capture expected robustness trends, though their ability to capture these trends is often affected by the scenario of interest. These results demonstrate the potential value of complex network methods for lightweight analysis of robustness in SoS architecture alternatives, when appropriately supported by DoE methods for understanding their limitations.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2021.3064817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9388854","Complex networks;design of experiments;robustness;systems of systems;systems of systems architecture","Robustness;Nonhomogeneous media;Complex networks;Measurement;Computer architecture;System of systems;Symmetric matrices","","11","","45","CCBY","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Often, urban built infrastructures represent a critical node within the intertwined networks of an urban area. Current school environment are examples of Cuss including automatic access controls (AACs), guidance and alarm systems (GASs), digital clocks, heat and motion identification sensors, and remolding spaces such as classrooms. A safe school environment can be created using parallel methods such as preventive, proactive and readiness for reactive resilience. Espoo City is constructing a new school campus Opinmäki and Laurea University of Applied Sciences acts as a safety and security consultant within the project. This paper focuses on needs for improved understanding of school security solutions, mainly covering readiness for reactive methods of security. The paper presents two technical security solutions: 1) technical control and reporting emergency incident and 2) design of security room. AAC tags can be identification cards, wristbands, necklaces, and others. The person who has a tag can be identified. These persons can be teachers, staff, students or someone who need access. This solution allows an access in building facilities to only identified authorize people. Students can move around without tags during the day in the public area that is not locked, like most of the classrooms or they have identification cards to get access to labs and other facilities. Children in the daycare wear a special wristband that helps identifying them, enhancing cost savings with automating routine operations. The heat and air conditioning systems can automatically set correct working level when system identifies a number of people in the building. AAC is linked to video surveillance working in public areas and entrances. Video surveillance being used for two purposes: 1) in crisis situations recordings can be explored and hand over to the police, 2) to count the number of people in the variable areas. Normally classes are not monitored as teachers have control on accessing student spaces. However, there can be provision of class monitoring on major events or bigger classes. During off-hours, all the safety measures are active, and all persons should have their identification cards and all movements in school will be registered in the system. Doors cannot be opened when the video surveillance system detects more than one person tries to enter in 'only one person' at a time entrance. Analyzing software counts the number of people that enter or leave the area. Camera must be positioned almost perpendicular on top of the doorway. Another option is to install thermal cameras in every room, to count the exact number of people in a room. This technology does not reveal the identity of people in the room, hence nobody's privacy will be compromised. The school has heat and movement sensors installed in every room's roof structures. Sensors can identify the number of people in every room. Digital clocks being used for dual capabilities exist in all rooms. In the normal situation, they display time, but within problematic situation they show the alarm code. Alarms can be set automatically or manually. Manual setting has addition feature of identifying problematic space. The alarm shows various codes for alerting people to hide or leave the room, also alerts about required help in the space. The alarm is displayed in all spaces, classrooms and corridors of the problem situation. The alarm system can be monitored and controlled from the safety room and from each teacher's desk using touch-screen computer. The system can be used also by the specific application that is installed to a laptop computer and mobile phones. The software will be planned as simple and user friendly. Security aspects must be taken in to account when designing the software. There must be specialized security applications to ensure a safe and automatic control of the school. Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is used when checking the information security management process when designing the software. In imminent threats, teachers press the alarm button under the table. This kind of alarm will be activated immediately. In emergencies, use of the exit is controlled by emergency escape lighting technology and voice control. The school should build in such a way that it is easy to exit compare to entering access. Leaving from indoors must be easy and accessible. There are addition benefits of lighting technology including alerting, escorting and rescuing from dangers. Another part of the technical monitoring is a security room concept. The room should be very safe in emergencies, and you can monitor and control security from there. The security room can be accessed and reached only by limited staff members such as set teachers and the janitor. It is protected using layered security so that staff can work and control any dangers without any fear. The security room also functions as the control center for surveillance and live stream cameras in real-time security measures. The security room can be useful for many other security controls like door locks, access controls and treatment area.","","978-1-4673-2358-1","10.1109/EISIC.2012.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298846","Cyber-physical system;Public safety;Resilience of build infrastructures;Safety and security;School security","Security;Educational institutions;Safety;Aerospace electronics;Monitoring;Software;Resilience","","8","","7","IEEE","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main purpose of blockchain technology is to provide anonymous transactions between participants, over a peer-to-peer network, using a decentralized distributed ledger. The goal of this novel approach is to eliminate any 3rd party validation and replace the trust of a central authority for transaction validation with cryptographic proof. While most applications of the blockchain revolve around cryptocurrencies, the blockchain can be used in many other fields, such as finance, distributed data storage, health and medicine, automation, etc. By creating an open, decentralized network, the blockchain can be used to develop decentralized applications and enable data access and sharing on a much higher level than the common implementations of client-server architectures which are in use today. In this paper, we will present a proof of concept method for field devices to store and share data using a distributed ledger built on the IOTA tangle, as well as provide means of access to the data which can be used in IoT and decentralized applications.","","978-1-5386-5683-9","10.1109/MECO.2018.8406041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406041","blockchain;internet of things;decentralized;distributed;data provider;tangle","Cryptography;Peer-to-peer computing;Distributed databases;Embedded computing;Internet of Things;Computers","","34","","9","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, FOCUS adopts a challenge-response authentication to protect the VPN server against potential DDoS attacks, which can further enhance the security of the IoT system. Such a double protection scheme is effective in mitigating various malicious attacks and can provide a high standard security for the IoT system. Furthermore, FOCUS is implemented in fog computing that is close to the end users, thus achieving a fast response and an efficient network consumption.

The wireless sensors relay their packets on to the base station via multi-hop transmissions and the overall functioning of the system, therefore, is dependent on these intermediate nodes. However, unbalanced data forward amongst the nodes results in high-energy consumption and packets drop. The network lifetime and link reliability are the most important factors for the network to work for longer period of time, hence optimum selection of the paths for packet routing is key for prolonged network life. This paper proposes a link quality-oriented route (LQOR) protocol for scalable IoT networks. The main goal of this scheme is to balance the network load by intelligently selecting the next hop with less number of neighbouring nodes. The comparative performance evaluation corroborates the positive impact of the algorithm as compared to other related techniques existing in the literature. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves less packets loss and average number of paths, minimizing data retransmissions.

In IoT environments, authentication is a big challenge because of the heterogeneity in protocols, devices, and topologies. IoT devices that communicate with each other need to be authentic, in order to avoid different types of attacks that are related to the negligence of authentication.

While botnets with such attacks caused serious security risk to the Internet infrastructure for years, there has been no network forensics technique that can classify, identify, and track the behavior of sophisticated botnets to date. In recent years, so there are many studies that have used classification techniques like an algorithm decision tree to train and validate modeling to define these botnet attacks, but they still produced high errors in assist investigating botnet traces. This motivated the development of a new classification techniques algorithm for network forensics based on the identification of network flows and that could track the suspected botnet activity in the infected network.

IoT applications are present in many fields ranging from mining and exploration to security and surveillance. This arguably, is the second Internet revolution. For traditional internet applications, the wireless channel is the main communication medium. IoT networked applications, however, can be deployed in different environments such as underwater and subterranean. In these environments, the wireless communication medium is obviously not air. Radio signal suffers severe attenuation in water. In contrast, acoustic signal performs much better. For this reason acoustic signal is often considered in underwater IoT networks. Several factors affect the propagation of acoustic signal in water including frequency, distance, temperature, shipping activity, wind, salinity, depth and density. Given the many variables affecting the channel, simple mathematical modeling is not adequate and comprehensive models get very complex very quickly. Simulation modeling then becomes the only viable alternative for the modeling and analysis of underwater networks. Aside from a basic model in ns-2 & ns-3, there aren't any other simulators that model signal propagation for underwater environments. In this work, we develop a module for the acoustic channel in JiST/SWANS (Java in Simulation Time / Scalable Wireless Ad hoc Network Simulator). JiST/SWANS is a high-performance discrete event simulator written in Java, and it is very efficient in its memory usage. This makes it ideal for modeling and simulation of a large number of nodes, a typical scenario in IoT networks. We perfomed several simulation scenarios to validate our module. Our contribution is providing a scalable platform to study the performance of large-scale acoustic underwater IoT networks using the JiST/SWANS simulator.","1558-058X","978-1-5386-6133-8","10.1109/SECON.2018.8479242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479242","Internet of Things (IoT);Underwater Networks;Acoustic Channel Modeling","Mathematical model;Underwater acoustics;Propagation losses;Internet of Things;Meters;Signal to noise ratio","","6","","7","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though IoT deals with heterogeneous devices and protocols, it is a herculean task for the developer to standardize the software architecture and testing models. This research work focuses on the software aspects of an IoT based system. This work proposes a reference software paradigm for the IoT systems by considering the software architecture design phase and testing phase.

IoT provides real-time data exchange through wired or wireless networks with no standards being developed to regulate the flow of information within system. As such, the security and access control in the IoT has become an issue of prominence. Now days, researchers understood the potentiality of the Blockchain (BC) in context with the security and authentication. More specifically the decentralized nature of BC makes it apt for integration with the IoT networks. In this paper, we propose a model that makes use of the blockchain concept to bridle the security and authentication problems in the IoT network.

But this connectedness also leads to more challenges in data security and the increased risk of cyber-attacks. Improved, and faster, security schemes have become a key requirement of these loT technologies. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been used to accelerate various cyber-security algorithms. However, while FPGAs are capable of massive computational power, through their highly parallel nature, they are generally difficult to program; and considering the design of modern encryption schemes this is posing a significant bottleneck to progress in security for these architectures. This paper investigates the use of a Python-based high-level FPGA design tool-flow for rapid prototyping of loT cryptosystems. In this paper we implement a version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, with block and key sizes of 128bits, using the Python-based tool-flow. The design is functionally verified, a Verilog hardware implementation is generated, simulated and then executed on an FPGA platform. The performance of the resulting FPGA design is analyzed in terms of resource utilization and throughput, and is compared against similar hand-written AES implementations reported in the literature. We found our FPGA implementation had a frequency of 512.742 MHz and a throughput of 65.63Gbps which is more than fast enough for most IoT applications.","","978-1-5386-7972-2","10.1109/ICMIMT.2019.8712074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8712074","component;Internet of Things (loT);cyber-security;rapid prototyping;FPGA","Field programmable gate arrays;Ciphers;Internet of Things;Hardware;Encryption;Hardware design languages","","4","","22","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this limitation of CoAP, there is a simple extension of the CoAP using a clustering approach: cluster-based CoAP for message queueing. In this paper, we propose an enhanced cluster-based CoAP scheme for efficient gathering of sensing data. By using a cache memory on the cluster head, the communication performance can be improved in the IoT networks. From testbed experimentation of the enhanced cluster-based CoAP, we can see that the proposed scheme provides better performance than the CoAP and existing cluster-based CoAP scheme, in terms of bandwidth utilization.

The leakage of these data will cause very serious consequences. Traditional access control is prone to single point of failure. The existing researches on the combination of blockchain and access control have some disadvantages, such as the difficulty of managing access rights, inefficient access efficiency, and the difficulty of supporting lightweight IOT devices. This paper proposes an IoT access control model based on blockchain smart contract, called SCBAC. Firstly, by adopting the idea of IoT Attributes Based Access Control(ABAC), the model supports a dynamic, fine-grained access control. Secondly, by deploying the access control strategy on the blockchain in the form of smart contracts, the computing pressure of IoT devices is reduced, so that the model can be applied to lightweight IoT devices and has tamper resistance and traceability characteristics. The idea of tokens is adopted into the strategy, and subjects obtain access rights by applying for tokens in advance, which improves access efficiency. In addition, Trust recommendation algorithm is adopted in the model, which effectively solves the problem of identity fraud in access control. Finally, we build a prototype system to verify this proposed model, through case analysis and security analysis, it shows that this access control model is effective and versatile.

There will be some redundancy in the data because different sensor nodes typically notice the same phenomenon.

To ensure the dependable performance of IoT systems, anomaly identification in the realm of IoT is a crucial responsibility. Manually detecting anomalous occurrences has grown more challenging with the abundance of data collected by IoT devices. As a result, machine learning(ML) methods have been suggested for IoT systems' anomaly recognition. A publicly available dataset for anomaly detection was used to assess the model. For data preparation, selecting features, and choosing models, the approach employs a number of ML techniques, including Decision Tree(DT), Logistic Regression(LR), Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Random Forest(RF). Criteria like recall, accuracy, precision, and F1-score have been used to measure these models' performance. The outcomes show that the employed strategy is effective in detecting network anomalies and improving the security of IoT systems.

Balanced sharing of resource loads must improve pheromone updating with an Internet virtual machine quality function in a load imbalance situation and complete Internet resource load scheduling. Traditional methods improve the heuristic information through IOT resource tasks and a resource matching degree function but do not focus on the improvement of resource pheromone updating, which leads to non-ideal scheduling effects. A type of IOT resource scheduling optimization method is proposed in this paper, which is based on the ant colony optimization algorithm. We consider various costs and factors in an IOT virtual machine; adjust states of the IOT virtual machine; calculate and adjust each resource's scheduling and dynamically schedule the IOT based on resource load history data and the current load condition of the IOT; realize the dynamic scheduling of IOT resources; improve the unbalanced load of an IOT virtual machine; improve pheromone updating with an Internet virtual machine mass function; and finally realize the load balanced sharing scheduling of IOT resources. Our experimental results show that the proposed method has obvious advantages in terms of task execution time and it can effectively maintain the load balanced sharing of resources on an IOT virtual machine.","","978-1-7281-4743-7","10.1109/ICCC47050.2019.9064189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064189","internet of things;resource load;balanced scheduling","Task analysis;Virtual machining;Mathematical model;Internet of Things;Dynamic scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Resource management","","1","","10","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While this low energy envelope have made them near ubiquitous, it is also a huge bottleneck in real world deployments. A fine balance needs to be achieved such that these devices can perform enough meaningful computation in a reasonable amount of time to justify their deployment while consuming a reasonable amount of power to keep them running for extended periods. A common method to achieve this is through computational offloading wherein these devices move the heavy computation away to the edge and the cloud thereby increasing the network lifetime. Offloading computation from these devices also improves their performance as the computations are performed by powerful hardware at the edge and the cloud. However, this increases power consumption and network latencies from the need to transmit and receive extra synchronization data. Optimum performance can be achieved by intelligently deciding if the computation should be offloaded or performed locally - a task that is inherently difficult given the transient nature of the network and the systems. In this work, we formulate a distributed network optimization problem to achieve a balance between performance and energy consumption. Our simulation results show substantial network latency reduction and overall reduced power consumption.","2330-989X","978-1-7281-8903-1","10.1109/LATINCOM50620.2020.9282339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9282339","Internet of Things;computation offloading;edge computing;energy efficiency","Performance evaluation;Cloud computing;Power demand;Internet of Things;Synchronization;Transient analysis;Task analysis","","","","23","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a resilient recursive estimation algorithm that processes the measurement streams to recover the value of the parameter, even when a subset of the devices fall under attack.

Because of application diversity, limited bandwidth of end devices and the demand for real time, it is necessary to decrease the cost of data access in Heterogeneous Distributed Cloud Storage System (HDCSS). According to the point that applications always access the partial data, this paper combining the data access rate, proposes a degraded read scheme based Local Reconstruction Code (LRC) to improve the local max throughput in HDCSS.

To minimize losses and ensure an adequate emergency response, it is vital to prepare the community for greater shock absorption and recovery after an occurrence. This raises the concept of community resilience and also demands appropriate metrics and prediction models for improved preparedness and adaptability. While a community is impacted in three main ways during a disaster, namely social, physical, and cyber there are currently no tools to model their interrelationship. Thus, this article presents a multiagent cyber–physical–social model of community resilience, taking into account the interconnection of power systems, emergency services, social communities, and cyberspace. To validate the model, we used data on two hurricanes (Irma and Harvey) collected from Twitter, GoogleTrends, FEMA, power utilities, CNN, and Snopes (a fact-checking organization). We also describe methods for quantifying social metrics, such as the level of anxiety, risk perception, and cooperation using social sensing, natural language processing, and text mining tools. We examine the suggested paradigm through three different case studies: 1) hurricanes Irma and Harvey; 2) a group of nine agents; and 3) a society comprised of six distinct communities. According to the results, cooperation can positively change individual behavior. Relationships within a community are so crucial that a smaller population with greater empathy may be more resilient. Similar dynamic changes in social characteristics occur when two empathetic communities share resources after a disaster.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3277450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129123","Community resilience;critical infrastructures;cyber–physical–social system;fake news;natural language processing;power systems;social media;urban computing","Resilience;Critical infrastructure;Hurricanes;Fault tolerance;Measurement;Internet of Things;Fake news","","4","","112","IEEE","18 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to enhance the resilience of the power systems, a networked topology optimization (NTO) based model is proposed to mitigate the coordinated cyber-physical attacks. Resilience metrics are proposed to evaluate the power system resilience against the coordinated cyber-physical attacks. Case studies were conducted on the modified IEEE 57-bus and 118-bus systems to illustrate the impacts of coordinated cyber-physical attacks as well as validate the proposed NTO based approach. The results of the case studies show that the proposed NTO based mitigation strategy can effectively reduce the load loss of the power system under the coordinated cyber-physical attacks.

The major concern in WSN is the limited battery power, which can be overcome by selecting the effective cluster head (CH) for the transmission of data in the network. In this paper, an entropy weighted-based I-LEACH protocol is developed for the selection of the CH. The proposed entropy weighted-based I-LEACH protocol is developed by modifying the standard LEACH protocol with the entropy weight. Initially, the IoT nodes are grouped together to form clusters, which is followed by the selection of the cluster head (CH) for the transmission of the data packets to the base station (BS). The CH is selected depending on the threshold value, which is based on the entropy function. The performance metrics, such as number of alive nodes and energy is used for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed entropy weighted-based (EWB) I-LEACH protocol. The proposed EWB I-LEACH protocol obtained a maximal alive nodes of 11 and maximal energy of 0.1138 J for 50 nodes under dual-slop channel model and obtained a maximal alive nodes of 9 and maximal energy of 0.1116 J for 50 nodes by considering log normal shadowing channel model when compared to the existing protocols.","","978-1-7281-8420-3","10.1109/GCAIoT51063.2020.9345819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345819","Wireless Sensor Network;Internet of Things;routing;data transmission;sensor nodes","Measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Entropy;Internet of Things;Standards;Shadow mapping","","1","","9","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When such applications connect to the Internet, they attempt to send data to other devices across the network. Because certain IoT applications transmit crucial data over the Internet, the data must be protected. However, these IoT devices are limited in terms of power, computation and memory, as well as communication capabilities. IoT devices are being used as a gateway into the larger IoT network. As a result, the security of these devices has become critical in order to protect them from numerous security risks and attacks. There are multiple solutions to mitigate the issue but Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a prominent one that provides hardware based security but designed primarily for large compute platforms (e.g., desktops, laptops, servers, etc.). Because of the limitations of IoT devices, the traditional method is unsuitable for IoT network & devices and a lightweight and optimized mechanism will be required. Firmware-based Lightweight Trusted Platform Module (FLTPM) is our suggested approach for augmenting hardware security to resource-constrained devices, which includes lightweight cryptography algorithms & services related to providing hardware security, and trusted/safe boot mechanisms.

Furthermore, data sets collected by IIoT nodes often display outliers, which are usually caused by anomalous events or errors. These outliers contain considerable valuable information, which prevent the normal operation of the system. Thus, methodologies are able to quantify the obtained information to protect the high priority IIoT nodes, are crucial. This study aims at developing such a method driven by sixth-generation (6G) networks. The proposed algorithm uses a multidimensional data relationship diagram to characterize the spatiotemporal correlations among heterogeneous data. Then, an autoregressive exogenous model is used to eliminate the effects of noise on sensor data, and to help in detecting anomalies. Finally, the algorithm produces a Cumulative Coefficient of Value (CCoV), to identify high-value sensing devices and enable massive Internet of Things (IoT) with 6G-using the characteristic patterns hidden within the data.

On the other hand, these advancements have necessitated the low-powered IoT to be designed with limited cost, low-energy consumption and efficient spectrum utilization. The issue of spectrum utilization is solved by cognitive radio (CR) network, a low-cost solution to utilize the spectrum efficiently. In CR networks the underutilized licensed spectrum is exploited by unlicensed users opportunistically. Due to their opportunistic nature, the performance of these networks depends on the observed spectrum pattern of a primary user. Therefore, perfect modeling of the spectrum detection and utilization is required in these networks. In this paper, we propose a primary user detection model for Cognitive Radio based Internet of Things (CR-IoT) using the hidden Markov model.

A cyber-resilience validation platform is developed, integrating hardware-in-the-loop with domain-specific simulation tools, to ensure accurate replication of real-world cyber-physical scenarios. An integral aspect of this framework is the real-time exploitation of metrics for agile responses to attacks. Validating our approach with an IEEE 34-bus test feeder for the physical domain and Cisco Modeling Lab for the cyber domain shows a 43% to 66% reduction in average latency compared to scenarios without our proposal during attacks, alongside enhanced rewards in both communication and physical networks.

In this paper, we study the resource consumption of the TLS handshake using a testbed in which an IoT board (Cypress CYW43907) communicates with a Raspberry Pi server over an 802.11 wireless link. Although TLS supports a wide-array of encryption algorithms, we focus on the performance of TLS using three of the most popular and robust cipher suites. Our experiments show that ciphers using Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDHE) key exchange are considerably more efficient than ciphers using Diffie Hellman (DHE). Furthermore, ECDSA signature verification consumes more time and energy than RSA signature verification given ECDHE key exchange.

Unfortunately, the current sub-6-GHz band is already congested, and lower-band communication is hard to support the high data rate transmission. The millimeter-wave (mmWave)-based communication technology is a promising solution to support the high rate transmission in a new band. However, the high power consumption and hardware cost of the mmWave communication system violates the low-cost design principle of IoT devices, which is a heavy burden for the mmWave application on IoT. In this work, we propose the multiple IoT nodes access-based wireless beam modulation (WBM) technology for the mmWave transmission, where the WBM employs the over-the-air modulation to achieve the low-cost mmWave hardware design with hundreds of megabit per second transmission. To support multiple IoT nodes access, we first design a hyper grant-based and grant-free protocols to achieve the balance between robustness and low latency access. The multiple beam search method is proposed to accelerate the beam alignment process. The channel estimation of WBM is achieved by the pilot detection and beam estimation process, where an iterative pilot cancelation beam estimation method is proposed. According to the simulation and hardware implementation results, the WBM-based communication system can provide a much higher data rate transmission service than the current IoT-based communication systems, and much lower power consumption and hardware cost than the mmWave-based system.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3045084","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9295330","Internet of Things (IoT);millimeter wave (mmWave);sixth-generation (6G) communication;wireless beam modulation (WBM)","Hardware;Internet of Things;Antenna arrays;6G mobile communication;Array signal processing;Communication systems;Power demand","","9","","35","IEEE","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

IoT-related vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited can affect, not only the device itself but also the application field in which the IoT device operates. Evidently, identifying and addressing every single vulnerability are an arduous, if not impossible, task. Attack taxonomies can assist in classifying attacks and their corresponding vulnerabilities. Security countermeasures and best practices can then be leveraged to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities before they emerge into catastrophic attacks and ensure overall secure IoT operation. Therefore, in this article, we provide an attack taxonomy, which takes into consideration the different layers of the IoT stack, i.e., device, infrastructure, communication, and service, and each layer’s designated characteristics, which can be exploited by adversaries.

They aim to achieve large-scale, networked control of dynamical systems and processes such as electricity and gas distribution networks and deliver pervasive information services by combining state-of-the-art computing, communication, and control technologies. However, CPSs are often highly nonlinear and uncertain, and their intrinsic reliance on open communication platforms increases their vulnerability to security threats, which entails additional challenges to conventional control design approaches. Indeed, sensor measurements and control command signals, whose integrity plays a critical role in correct controller design, may be interrupted or falsely modified when broadcasted on wireless communication channels due to cyber attacks. This can have a catastrophic impact on CPS performance. In this paper, we first conduct a thorough analysis of recently developed secure and resilient control approaches leveraging the solid foundations of adaptive control theory to achieve security and resilience in networked CPSs against sensor and actuator attacks.

Compared with existing studies, the distribution characteristics and correlations between propagation paths in the elevation (e)- and azimuth (a)-angle domains are considered to enhance the estimation performance. Specifically, we first redefine the e-angles and the a-angles to simplify the system model. Then, a novel autoregressive (AR)-Gaussian channel prior is proposed to capture both the sparsity and the clustering properties of mmWave massive MIMO IoT channels. After that, we provide a channel approximation method to overcome the channel uncertainty by exploiting the structure of the AR-Gaussian channel prior. The hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture with limited radio-frequency (RF) chains in mmWave IoT systems is also considered. Finally, we propose a hybrid channel estimation algorithm, which consists of two stages. Based on the different distribution characteristics in different angle domains, the CS-based channel estimation is performed for e-angles on stage one, while the SBL-based channel estimation is applied for a-angles on stage two. Numerical results reveal that compared with the existing CS- and SBL-only methods, the proposed hybrid channel estimation algorithm exhibits better performance in terms of computational complexity, sparsity robustness, and estimation accuracy.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3094990","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau(grant numbers:0036/2019/A1,SKL-IOTSC2021-2023); Research Committee of the University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00156-FST); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFE0120600); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9475482","Channel estimation;compressed sensing (CS);massive multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);millimeter-wave (mmWave);sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)","Channel estimation;Massive MIMO;Internet of Things;Estimation;Matching pursuit algorithms;Array signal processing;Computational complexity","","26","","52","IEEE","6 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to reduce the downtime and locate the failures becomes a core issue in system design. In this paper, we employ a hierarchical contract-based resilience framework to guarantee the stability of CPS. In this framework, we use Assume Guarantee (A-G) contracts to monitor the non-functional properties of individual components (e.g., power and latency), and hierarchically compose such contracts to deduce information about faults at the system level. The hierarchical contracts enable rapid fault detection in large-scale CPS. However, due to the vast number of components in CPS, manually designing numerous contracts and the hierarchy becomes challenging. To address this issue, we propose a technique to automatically decompose a root contract into multiple lower-level contracts depending on I/O dependencies between components. We then formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to search the optimal parameters of each lower-level contract. This enables automatic contract refinement taking into consideration the communication overhead between components. Finally, we use a case study from the manufacturing domain to experimentally demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.","2325-1301","978-1-7281-3197-9","10.1109/RTCSA.2019.8864556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8864556","Contract Synthesis;Automatic Contract Generation;Cyber-Physical Systems;Resilience Decentralized Algorithms","Contracts;Resilience;Monitoring;Power system stability;System performance;Silicon;Cyber-physical systems","","3","","19","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The lack of transparency and interpretability in existing Artificial Intelligence techniques would reduce human users’ trust in the models used for cyber defence, especially in current scenarios where cyber resilience is becoming increasingly diverse and challenging. Explainable AI (XAI) should be incorporated into developing cybersecurity models to deliver explainable models with high accuracy that human users can understand, trust, and manage. This paper explores the following concepts related to XAI. A summary of current literature on XAI is discussed. Recent taxonomies that help explain different machine learning algorithms are discussed. These include deep learning techniques developed and studied extensively in other IoT taxonomies. The outputs of AI models are crucial for cybersecurity, as experts require more than simple binary outputs for examination to enable the cyber resilience of IoT systems. Examining the available XAI applications and safety-related threat models to explain resilience towards IoT systems also summarises the difficulties and gaps in XAI concerning cybersecurity.

With IoT being a common data source for digital twins, this paper utilizes an indoor environment monitoring IoT testbed to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the latency, accuracy, and AI capacity.

Running complex tasks such as that are machine learning-based with minimum energy consumption is a challenge. It requires complex algorithms to run locally such as on middleware fog within the proximity of the devices generating data, or globally in a cloud to analyze the acquired data and create robust and smart applications. However, it depends on the type of task execution policy applied at each level; local or global, to decide on energy and performance efficiency, since certain tasks are high in complexity. Hence, task execution will be hierarchically distributed among the IoT nodes, fog, and cloud. Given that, we present in this paper a three-tier IoT-fog-cloud model. We argue that with distributed task execution, we can achieve high scalability of IoT services, and manage the global energy consumption as well. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our three-tier architecture by taking into account computational tasks for various applications in IoT related to medical, multimedia, location-based, and text. We evaluate using real datasets, based on three scenarios: fog-only, cloud-only, and fog-cloud collaborative. Task execution policy (at fog/cloud) play a key role in efficiently processing a task (especially large tasks, such as in deep learning). Therefore, we take that into account and elaborate what types of policies suit what type of offloading environment (fog-only, cloud-only, or fog-cloud collaborative).","2377-3782","","10.1109/TSUSC.2020.3028615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9214500","Cloud of Things;computational offloading;fog computing;Internet of Things (IoT);middleware;task offloading;three-tier","Cloud computing;Task analysis;Middleware;Edge computing;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Energy consumption","","48","","37","IEEE","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With regard to means to goal achievement, SoS relies on each CSs' roles and assigned responsibilities. Due to the complex and characteristics of SoS, there still remains additional efforts to deal and address the challenges posed in the modeling and analysis of SoS behavior. In this paper, we presented an SoS behavior analysis approach via simulation. Our behavior analysis approach is similar to that of chaos engineering in that we inject stimuli into the system and then analyze the system behavior. Our simulation engine is based on discrete time multi-agent simulation. In our experiment, to mimic the real-world phenomenon into the simulation, we identified the real-world events that occurred in the real-world Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) response SoS. With the identified real-world events, we defined stimuli which can represent the real-world events and issues in real-world MCI.

The main advantages of this data driven methodology is that the ability of leveraging heterogeneous data streams that are available from the CPSs and the ability of performing the monitoring with minimal a priori domain knowledge. The main objective of the framework is to warn the operators of any degradation in cyber, physical or overall health of the CPS. The framework consists of four components: 1) Data acquisition and feature extraction, 2) state identification and real time state estimation, 3) cyber-physical health calculation and 4) operator warning generation. Further, this paper presents an initial implementation of the first three phases of the framework on a CPS testbed involving a Microgrid simulation and a cyber-network which connects the grid with its controller.

Moreover, rigorous energy constraints are considered to characterize IoT devices as practically as possible. A multiantenna UAV is employed, which can communicate with a cluster of single-antenna IoT devices to form a virtual MIMO link. We formulate a whole-trajectory-oriented optimization problem, where the transmission duration and the transmit power of all devices are jointly designed to maximize the data collection efficiency for the whole flight. Different from previous studies, only the slowly varying large-scale channel state information is assumed available, to coincide with the fact that practically it is quite difficult to predictively acquire the random small-scale channel fading prior to the UAV flight.

The results show that in the access success rate analysis, the access success rate is the highest with an access time ( T) of 5 s and a preamble resource number ( K) of 25. The restriction factor is inversely proportional to the access success rate. In the node utilization analysis, different transmission node priorities result in different node utilization, and priority 2's node utilization is better than that of priority 1. Moreover, local data makes data analysis and transmission faster. The search time is prolonged, and the corresponding energy consumption is also higher without local data. In the energy consumption analysis, with the 6-generation (6G) technology, different interference thresholds lead to the different energy efficiency of data transmission. The larger the interference threshold, the higher the energy efficiency.

For example, an adversary can easily tamper with the information transmitted over a public channel, in the sense of modification, deletion, and fabrication of data-in-transit and data-in-storage. Time-critical IoT applications such as healthcare may demand the capability to support external parties (users) to securely access IoT data and services in real-time. This necessitates the design of a secure user authentication mechanism, which should also allow the user to achieve security and functionality features such as anonymity and un-traceability. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight anonymous user authenticated session key agreement scheme in the IoT environment. The proposed scheme uses three-factor authentication, namely a user's smart card, password, and personal biometric information. The proposed scheme does not require the storing of user specific information at the gateway node. We then demonstrate the proposed scheme's security using the broadly accepted real-or-random (ROR) model, Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, and automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPAs) software simulation tool, as well as presenting an informal security analysis to demonstrate its other features.

Though accessing sensing data and making decisions through IoT smart devices turns out to be commonplace, it is challenging to guarantee user privacy and preserve the accuracy (integrity) of the collected data. The IoT smart devices frequently lose either IoT user's privacy or data integrity. This also makes it crucial to put a threshold on the cost of computation and load of the IoT devices, as gradually more IoT services demand access to the resources that devices offer. In this article, we propose BalancePIC, a scheme that attempts to preserve a balance in the three aspects (user privacy, data integrity in edge-assisted IoT devices, and the computational cost). It achieves the balance through a balanced truth discovery approach and a proposed enhanced technique for data privacy, which are used in IoT devices and edge server interactions. It authenticates the IoT user participation with privacy in the truth discovery process through a biometric-ECC-based authentication algorithm. The nature of the BalancePIC scheme is to straightforwardly provide the likelihood for a simple amendment on the cryptography technique and weight assignment. This lessens the overall computational cost for the IoT user devices but also restricts the communications between the user devices and the edge server, which is important for data integrity. We present an enhanced technique to preserve privacy by guarding the user from potential threats and suspicious data collection parties. To achieve this, BalancePIC takes steps to blur the original sensory data of the device by processing results in groups called zones. Simulation result analysis provides evidence for the balance preservation in the three aspects.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2951687","Fordham University Faculty Research Grant; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB1001800); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672276,61872219); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2019MF001); Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization, Nanjing University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891776","Biometric;data collection;data integrity;ECC;Internet of Things (IoT);privacy;security;truth discovery","Internet of Things;Data privacy;Data integrity;Servers;Sensors;Computational efficiency","","93","","28","IEEE","5 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a novel context-aware mechanism for on-chain data allocation in IoT-blockchain systems. Specifically, we design a data controller based on fuzzy logic to calculate the Rating of Allocation (RoA) value of each data request considering multiple context parameters, i.e., data, network, and quality and decide its on-chain allocation. Furthermore, we illustrate how the design and realization of the mechanism lead to refinements of two commonly used IoT-blockchain architectural styles (i.e., blockchain-based cloud and fog). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we instantiate the data allocation mechanism in the blockchain-based cloud and fog architectures and evaluate their performance using FogBus. We also compare the efficacy of our approach to the existing decision-making mechanisms through the deployment of a real-world healthcare application.

On the other hand, the assemblage characteristic of the collaborative computing in IoT has not been received attention. Therefore, in this article, we present a clustering-based sharded blockchain strategy for collaborative computing in the IoT, where the sharding of the blockchain system is implemented in two steps: K-means-clustering-based user grouping and the assignment of consensus nodes. In this framework, how to reasonably group the IoT users while simultaneously guaranteeing the system performance is the key point. Specifically, we describe the data transactions among IoT devices by data transaction flow graph (DTFG) based on a dynamic stochastic block model. Then, formed as a Markov decision process (MDP), the optimization of the cluster number (shard number) and the adjustment of consensus parameters are jointly trained by deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

Therefore, trust management is a backbone for the successful and secure transmission of data among various nodes in a large-scale IoT network. To overcome the security issues, latency, and risk of malicious activities, a lightweight approach is proposed for those nodes in Industrial IoT that cannot maintain security. LightTrust utilizes a centralized trust agent to generate and manage trust certificates that allow nodes to communicate for a specific time without performing trust computations. Trust agents also maintain a trust database to store the current trust degree for the aggregation/propagation purposes. Trust between two nodes is developed by direct observations in terms of compatibility, cooperativeness, and delivery ratio, whereas recommendations are used to develop trust in the context of indirect observations, i.e., experience or previous knowledge. The comparative simulations of the proposed and existing approaches are also performed whereby the results illustrate that the proposed approach efficiently maintains resilience and robust environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3081422","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University through Vice Deanship of Scientific Research Chairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9434372","Digital revolution;edge nodes;Industrial IoT (IIoT);Internet of Things (IoT);potential attacks;robust security;trust management","Trust management;Security;Reliability;Protocols;Industrial Internet of Things;Privacy;Databases","","41","","32","IEEE","18 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Designing resource allocation schemes to support such coexistent, heterogeneous communication is hence a key IoT challenge. In particular, there is a need for self-organizing resource allocation solutions that can account for unique IoT features, such as massive scale and stringent resource constraints. In this paper, a novel finite memory multistate sequential learning framework is proposed to enable diverse IoT devices to share limited communication resources, while transmitting both delay-tolerant, periodic messages and urgent, critical messages. The proposed learning framework enables the IoT devices to learn the number of critical messages and to reallocate the communication resources for the periodic messages to be used for the critical messages. Furthermore, the proposed learning framework explicitly accounts for IoT device limitations in terms of memory and computational capabilities. The convergence of the proposed learning framework is proved, and the lowest expected delay that the IoT devices can achieve using this learning framework is derived. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm in IoT networks with different delay targets, network densities, probabilities of detection, and memory sizes is analyzed in terms of the probability of a successful random access (RA) request and percentage of devices that learned correctly. Simulation results show that, for a delay threshold of 1.25 ms, the average achieved delay is 0.71 ms and the delay threshold is satisfied with probability 0.87. Moreover, for a massive network, a delay threshold of 2.5 ms is satisfied with probability 0.92. The results also show that the proposed learning algorithm is very effective in reducing the delay of urgent, critical messages by intelligently reallocating the communication resources allocated to the delay-tolerant, periodic messages.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2903832","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2709); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663317","Finite memory learning;Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning;multistate learning","Internet of Things;Delays;Resource management;Uplink;Quality of service;Wireless networks;Simulation","","39","","33","IEEE","8 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With limited resources of IoT devices, mobile computation offloading can be exploited to offload part of the applications to nearby devices that have more powerful computing resources, thereby speeding up the applications and reducing the energy consumption. In this paper, we consider application partitioning and collaborative computation offloading in IoT networks, in order to meet the completion deadline of the applications while minimizing the overall energy consumption. The problem is formulated as a binary integer linear programming problem, which is transformed into a weighted bipartite matching problem and then solved by the centralized Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. To fit the large-scale IoT scenarios, three distributed algorithms are then introduced from different perspectives. The first one is referred to as the noncooperative matching (NCM) algorithm, where each node makes offloading decision based on its own interest in minimizing energy consumption. Afterward, an asynchronous greedy matching (AGM) algorithm is developed by considering the mutual interest of the requestor and collaborator pairs in terms of their energy consumptions. Finally, a maximum differential energy matching (MDEM) algorithm is devised by relaxing the network stability requirement, which can further benefit the energy efficiency for all network nodes. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that both the NCM and AGM algorithms guarantee the network stability and improve the energy saving compared with entirely local execution, while the MDEM algorithm can further achieve near-optimal energy consumption at the expense of higher implementation overheads.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2866945","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61603031); State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety(grant numbers:RCS2018ZT015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8444679","Collaborative computation offloading;Internet of Things (IoT);job partitioning;Kuhn–Munkres (K–M) algorithm;matching;network stability","Energy consumption;Cloud computing;Task analysis;Internet of Things;Collaboration;Partitioning algorithms;Servers","","33","","40","IEEE","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, we analyze the performance of the proposed massive BDMA scheme and derive a closed-form expression for the weighted sum rate in terms of channel conditions and system parameters. To improve the overall performance, we propose a massive access algorithm by jointly optimizing transmit power and receive vector.

As a critical component of the IoT, sensor networks have become ubiquitous and widely used in various application domains. However, open-ended wireless communication brings severe threats to user privacy and security. Attackers from outside the network can trace back along the data stream to capture the source node, which poses a significant threat to the privacy of the data source. A feasible defense method is to interfere with the attacker’s tracking process through forged data streams. However, the related traditional solutions generally have shortcomings in terms of balancing security and efficiency. Therefore, this article proposes a pseudopacket scheduling algorithm (PPSA), which aims at reasonably regulating the process of pseudopacket generation to interfere with the adversary’s tracking to the data source. The algorithm comprises three phases. First, the sink node performs geographic information acquisition and neighbor node discovery with a flood-based method. Then, the sink node uses a self-adapting proxy selection method to construct backbone routes with both randomness and low latency to receive actual packets. Finally, the nodes on both sides of the backbone routes follow a pseudopacket scheduling strategy to interfere with the adversary’s tracking of the source locations. The experimental results showcase that our proposed scheme effectively controls the additional energy consumption and transmission delays within acceptable ranges while ensuring adequate location privacy.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3117957","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2017YFE0125300); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:B210203066); Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Acoustics(grant numbers:SKLA202102); Jiangsu Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:BE2019648); Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX21_0477); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9559413","Artificial intelligence;Internet of Things (IoT);pseudopacket routing;sensor networks;source location privacy (SLP)","Routing;Internet of Things;Privacy;Energy consumption;Position measurement;Phantoms;Delays","","17","","25","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aiming to jointly optimize the sum SE and the maximum error probability, we first express the achievable SE as a function of the channel coefficients, precoders, and error probabilities. Subsequently, we formulate a problem with respect to precoders and error probabilities. A straightforward approach for the formulated problem, however, is challenging as it not only has multiple objectives but also is nonconvex. To resolve these issues, we first transform the problem as a single-objective optimization by using a weighted sum approach. Based on the reformulation, we propose an algorithm, in which error probabilities and precoders are determined by alternating two phases.

Based on our empirical data, the experimental results reveal that the packet interarrival time distribution at the gateway is close to generalized Pareto distribution for homogeneous eHealth and smart city traffic, whereas the Weibull distribution is the nearest to model the empirical packet interarrival time for the rest of the examined traffic patterns. Moreover, we show that employing the experimental findings to analyze the delay performance of connecting the gateway to the cloud, given certain backbone network resources, leads to accurate results.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3079115","UAE University UPAR(grant numbers:12N008/31N456); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9427960","Characterization;fog;gateway;interarrival time distribution;Internet of Things (IoT);traffic;WiFi","Logic gates;Internet of Things;Wireless fidelity;Smart cities;Delays;Cloud computing;Video surveillance","","10","","38","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In light of the diversified use cases and service requirements, the information freshness [or Age of Information (AoI)] of IoT data is key for latency-sensitive IoT applications (e.g., industrial automation and intelligent transportation) because stale information may lead to delayed responses and catastrophic outcomes. In addition, various types of IoT applications require the analytics of IoT data collected from their constituent IoT devices. While previous AoI-related works have analyzed or optimized the information freshness of various communication systems, the problem that the information cofreshness [or Coage of Information (CoI)] of an IoT application is determined by the maximum AoI of the constituent IoT devices has been rarely investigated. In this article, we address the grant assignment and transmission scheduling (GATS) problem for IoT and formulate it as an integer linear program (ILP) to minimize a weighted sum of CoI. Due to the intractability of the original GATS problem, we transform it to an equivalent problem of the maximization of the number of the eliminated age blocks. Then, we propose the CoI-aware age block elimination (CABEL) algorithm in which information updates are selected progressively according to their coage efficiency (CE) values and prove that the achieved approximation factor depends on the relative service costs and uplink delays. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution can effectively perform information updates and utilize service budgets, thereby achieving low CoI compared with the existing solutions under various parameter settings.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3052007","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP17K06435,JP20H00592,JP20K19794); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9326330","Age of Information (AoI);grant assignment (GA);information freshness;integer linear programming (ILP);Internet of Things (IoT);transmission scheduling (TS)","Internet of Things;Job shop scheduling;Uplink;Delays;Monitoring;Approximation algorithms;Transforms","","8","","53","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Encryption provides an effective and important means of protecting data privacy in the IoT. Because of resource limitations, to achieve high efficiency IoT devices require an encryption scheme that ensures that the encryption phase does not incur a heavy data transmission overhead. By virtue of its many advantages, the use of public-key encryption in current applications is widespread. Identity-based public-key encryption (IBE) removes the obstacle raised by the sophisticated certificate management required by other schemes, and its efficiency renders it more suitable for application in the IoT. However, a problem that needs to be solved in IBE is the revocation of a user whose private key may have been exposed. In this article, we present an efficient and practical IBE scheme having a revocation functionality to preserve data privacy in IoT applications. Elements in the system, such as sensors and actuators, can exchange encrypted data directly or via a cloud server. If a private key is compromised, the private key generator can revoke its user.

This new hybrid cloud infrastructure makes it possible to mix and match platforms and cloud providers for various software development activities. There are several benefits of the multi-cloud infrastructure such as lower level of vendor lock-in and minimize the risk of widespread data loss or downtime. However, it has many challenges such as non-standard and inherent complexity due to different technologies, interfaces, and services. Docker has introduced container-based software development approach in the past few years and gaining popularity in the software industry. It has recently introduced its distributed system development tool called Swarm, which extends the Docker container-based software development process on multiple hosts in multiple clouds without any interoperability issue. Docker Swarm-based distributed software development is a newborn approach for the cloud industry; nonetheless, it has a huge potential to provide multi-cloud development environment without worrying the complexity of it. This paper presents the simulation of building a virtual system of systems (SoS) for the distributed software development process on multiple clouds. This simulation of virtual SoS is based on Docker Swarm, VirtualBox, Mac OS X, nginx and redis. However, the same SoS can be created on any of the Docker supported cloud by just changing the driver name to the desired cloud name such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean, Google Compute Engine, Exoscale, Generic, OpenStack, Rackspace, IBM Softlayer, VMware vCloud Air.","","978-1-5090-0793-6","10.1109/SysEng.2016.7753148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7753148","Docker;Swarm;Cloud;Virtual System of Systems;SoS;Container;Virtual Machine","Cloud computing;Containers;Servers;Buildings;System of systems","","65","","12","Crown","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, connectivity plays a crucial role in enabling automated vehicles to navigate, as well as in regulating this newly established network of connected vehicles as efficiently and safely as possible. As a result, modern vehicles are equipped with Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to other systems (V2X) communication capabilities. Vehicles, traditionally considered as a monolithic system, now become part of an ecosystem of vehicles, infrastructure and mobility services that can be characterized as a System of Systems (SoS). This creates a need for safety methods that are applicable for analyzing SoS. In this paper, we investigate the impact of applying safety analysis to a SoS with a conventional, ""vehicle-centric"" development process. We propose a tailored safety lifecycle based on guidelines of ISO 26262 that is augmented to encompass additional considerations pertinent to a SoS. We performed a comparative study by applying our proposed method as well as the traditional (vehicle-centric) approach as per ISO 26262 for safety engineering of a truck platooning application. The comparison results show the overall effectiveness of the proposed method. The ""connected vehicles"" development process resulted in more safety goals compared with the vehicle-centric approach. This may, at first thought, suggest that this approach requires a significant effort increase as the number of safety goals is an indicator of the amount of needed effort for the safety engineering process. However, the safety analysis (e.g. fault tree analysis) of the platoon system from a vehicle-centric approach exponentially grows in size. This increase in complexity of analyses of the traditional vehicle-centric approach means that the actual effort required of the proposed method for the SoS is comparatively more efficient. Besides, the proposed method showed us that the resulting safety analysis, in particular, the fault trees are less prone to error as the complexity of the analysis is greatly reduced. Creating an appropriate level of abstraction for the vehicle and the platoon makes the analysis more effective. The reduced complexity also impacts verification and validation activities as vehicle and platoon level testing are specified and conducted separately. This research shows the increased trust in the safety of the platoon system by performing a ""connected vehicles"" safety analysis.","2472-9647","978-1-5386-3664-0","10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8369598","Functional Safety;System of Systems;Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment;Ecosystem Functional Safety","Hazards;Power capacitors;ISO Standards;System of systems;Fault trees;Roads","","15","","8","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, this is the start point for the EU FP7 project known as COMPASS (Comprehensive Modelling for Advanced Systems of Systems) that has funded this research. The application of model-based systems engineering is becoming well understood at the systems level, however, there is a lack of research and subsequent industrial application at the system of systems (SoS) level.

In order to assess the overall fitness measure of the System of Systems (SoS), a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) developed along with a set of feasible, participating systems and KPA-defining equations. A simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to find the optimized meta-architecture. Using the methodologies described in this paper, an optimized SoS meta-architecture for improving a legacy Metrorail system was generated and assessed.","","978-1-6654-4454-5","10.1109/SOSE52739.2021.9497492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497492","Metrorail;Meta-Architecture Generation;System of Systems;Fuzzy Inference System","Rails;Fuzzy logic;Databases;Scalability;Logic gates;Particle measurements;Reliability","","3","","3","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such systems are well adapted to satisfy the needs of smart cities and facilitate remote locations. Many cloud-based solutions for effective routing along with scalable data storage have been presented for constraint IoT systems. However, because of the unpredictable nature of mobile networks and communication links, most of the solutions may not be suitable for realistic applications and usually result in path failure with increasing resource utilization. Hence, data forwarding is only reliable and valuable if the proposed algorithms are trust aware with low overheads and consume balanced energy among nodes. Therefore, this article proposed a fault-tolerant supervised routing (Trust-FTSR) model for trust management in the IoT network, to improve trustworthiness and collaborative communication in smart cities. Each node evaluates the behavior of its neighbors and establishes a direct trust for a reliable and optimized network structure. In addition, using a supervised machine-learning technique, a fault-tolerant relaying system is provided without imposing additional overheads. Moreover, it removes the additional load in determining the optimal decision and training the IoT system to balance the network cost. In the end, a secure algorithm is proposed to ensure the privacy and authentication of the relaying system in the presence of critical attacks with secured keys. The proposed model is tested and its performance has significant improvement as compared to existing work.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3184632","Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics Lab (AIDA) CCIS Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Prince Sultan University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9800905","Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning;smart cities;technological development;trust management","Internet of Things;Routing;Smart cities;Relays;Computational modeling;Security;Fault tolerant systems","","29","","46","IEEE","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network provenance plays a crucial role in establishing the relationships between network entities. Hence IoT networks can be made forensic ready so that network provenance may be collected to help in constructing these artifacts. The paper proposes Ready-IoT, a novel forensic readiness model for IoT environment to collect provenance from the network which comprises of both network parameters and traffic.

In this paper, we investigated machine learning (ML) enabled anomaly detection models for the IoT with regard to multi-objective optimization (Pareto optimization) that minimizes the detection error, execution time, and memory consumption simultaneously. Making use of well-known datasets consisting of network traffic traces captured in an IoT environment, we studied a variety of machine learning algorithms through the world-class H2O AI platform. Our experimental results show that the Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, and Deep Learning models are the most accurate and fastest anomaly detection models; the Gradient Boosting Machine and Random Forest are the most accurate and memory-efficient models.

That is why many of IoT applications rely on multicast in their transmission. This multicast traffic need to be secured specially for critical applications involving actuators control. Securing multicast traffic by itself is cumbersome as it requires an efficient and scalable Group Key Management (GKM) protocol. In case of IoT, the situation is more difficult because of the dynamic nature of IoT scenarios. This paper introduces a solution based on using context aware security server accompanied with a group of key servers to efficiently distribute group encryption keys to IoT devices in order to secure the multicast sessions. The proposed solution is evaluated relative to the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) protocol. The comparison shows that the proposed scheme efficiently reduces the load on the key servers.

This efficiency vastly affects the productivity of the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes when utilized in an industrial environment. The conundrum of using the conventional network architecture in an industry/factory connected by IoT devices has paved the way for the development of software-defined networking (SDN). Traditional network architectures lack network programmability and hinder the testing and performance evaluation of new communication protocols. The use of vendor-specific hardware is a major hindrance to create a network where the control is centralized for the deployment of different policies over the network. This article aims to find an optimal path for efficient communication between the nodes present in a programmable Industrial IoT (IIoT) network. A programmable IIoT network is created and end-user routing algorithms are designed to find the optimal path for communication. We integrate an SDN framework with IIoT nodes for the creation of a centralized programmable network architecture and deploy custom routing algorithms over it for evaluation. To further reduce the communication latency, we incorporate edge computing servers (ECSs) in the network. Three routing algorithms: 1)  $K$ -means-based optimal path algorithm; 2) cluster-based optimal path algorithm; and 3) minimum interval-based optimal path algorithm, that can be deployed over an SDN are proposed in this article. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithms are more efficient than the existing algorithms.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3163228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9744110","Edge computing (EC);Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);Internet of Things (IoT);software-defined network (SDN)","Routing;Industrial Internet of Things;Protocols;Computer architecture;Network architecture;Smart manufacturing;Performance evaluation","","16","","28","IEEE","29 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present metrics to quantify the cyber-resilience level based on the design, structure, stability, and performance under the attack of a given CPS. The metrics provide reference points to evaluate whether the system is better prepared or not to face the adversaries.

However, Internet of Things development is hindered by the lack of standardized development guidance and learning resources. Moreover, the use of centralized IoT solutions introduces a single point of failure as well as exposes private data to a third-party, and may leads to data and privacy breach. This research proposes a decentralized IoT platform based on Kademlia protocol. This platform aims to ease the development of simple Internet of Things system as well as solving centralized system potential threats, such as single point of failure and data breach. The main concept of the platform is to establish an overlay network in which every member (node) in the network is able to access certain data stream available in the network. Every time a node receives a data stream from a data source, it replicates the data stream to some other node based on Kademlia, so the data stream is accessible to most member of the network. The platform can also perform as a simple API server for data stream for a stand-alone deployment. The platform, named Cadfort, is successfully developed and is able to support simple IoT API development. The publish and subscribe functionality is also working to some degree, in which it is able to lookup certain data keys successfully in a network sized less than 1000 nodes. However, on a network sized 1000 node or more, the node sometimes fails to find certain data keys, in which the success rate is around 80% in a network with 3000 nodes. The result shows that the platform is effective for moderately sized clusters up to 1000 nodes.","2640-0227","978-1-5386-7259-4","10.1109/ICODSE.2018.8705912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705912","Internet of Things;decentralized;peer to peer;kademlia;overlay network","Peer-to-peer computing;Internet of Things;Protocols;Overlay networks;Databases;Sensors;Testing","","2","","9","IEEE","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By applying cognitive radio (CR) capabilities to IoT, a novel cognitive radio IoT (CR-IoT) network arises as a promising solution to tackle the spectrum scarcity problem in conventional IoT network. CR is a form of wireless communication whereby a radio is dynamically programmed and configured to detect available spectrum channels. This enhances the spectrum utilization efficiency of radio frequency while avoiding interference and overcrowding to other users. Energy efficiency in CR-IoT network must be carefully formulated since the sensor nodes consume significant energy to support CR operations, such as in dynamic spectrum sensing and switching. In this paper, we study channel spectrum sensing to boost energy efficiency in clustered CR-IoT networks. We propose a two-way information exchange dynamic spectrum sensing algorithms to improve energy efficiency for data transmission in licensed channels. In addition, the concern of the energy consumption in dynamic spectrum sensing and switching, we propose an energy efficient optimal transmit power allocation technique to enhance the dynamic spectrum sensing and data throughput.

Traditional data representation approaches, such as semantic annotation, ontology, and semantic Web technology are rule based, which lack flexibility and adaptability when applied to IoT. To address the challenge, this article mainly focuses on the problem of semantic representation, which is essential for processing and fusion of IoT data. To serve as a bridge, we propose a high-level framework, namely, Things2Vec, which aims to produce the latent semantic representations from the interaction of things through the graph embedding technique. These semantic representations benefit various IoT semantic analysis tasks, such as the IoT service recommendation and automation of things. In Things2Vec, we utilize the graph to model the function sequence relationships that are generated by the interaction of things, which is called the IoT context graph. Since these function sequence relationships are heterogeneous in terms of semantics, it causes general graph embeddings to fail to learn complete information. Thus, we propose a biased random walk procedure, which is tailored to capture the neighborhoods of nodes with different types of semantic relationships. Extensive experiments are carried out, and our results show that the proposed method can effectively capture the semantic relationships among context-aware data in IoT.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2962630","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701190); Youth Science Foundation of Jilin Province(grant numbers:20180520021JH); National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0604500); Key Scientific and Technological Research and Development Plan of Jilin Province of China(grant numbers:20180201103GX); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M631873); Project of Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission(grant numbers:2019FGWTZC001); Key Technology Innovation Cooperation Project of Government and University for the Whole Industry Demonstration(grant numbers:SXGJSF2017-4); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944272","Graph embedding;Internet of Things (IoT);semantics","Internet of Things;Semantics;Programming;Ontologies;Context modeling;Data models;Semantic Web","","21","","30","IEEE","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While many researchers have attempted to model SoSs and verify SoS-level goals, little attention has been paid to how different types of SoSs are characterized and realized during modeling and verification. Using a mass casualty incident response system as a common working example for different types of a SoS, we model the types of SoS with probabilistic models of PRISM, which can capture uncertain behaviors of an SoS in a quantitative manner and perform statistical model checking in order to verify to which extent each type of SoS achieves the SoS-level goal. Differences between the different types of SoS are demonstrated in the probabilistic models and analyzed by statistical model checking.

RPL provides meager protection against routing or other forms of attacks. The resource-constrained nature of Fog nodes prevents the use of heavyweight cryptographic algorithms to achieve secured communication. A lightweight mechanism is thus essential to impart security in Fog-IoT networks.

Nowadays, most CPSs do not work in isolation, but their digital part is connected to the Internet in order to enable remote monitoring, control and configuration. Such a connection may offer entry-points enabling attackers to gain control silently and exploit access to the physical world at the right time to cause service disruption and possibly damage to the surrounding environment. Prevention and monitoring measures can reduce the risk brought by cyber attacks, but the residual risk can still be unacceptably high in critical infrastructures or services. Resilience - i.e., the ability of a system to withstand adverse events while maintaining an acceptable functionality - is therefore a key property for such systems. In our research, we seek a model-free, quantitative, and general-purpose evaluation methodology to extract resilience indexes from, e.g., system logs and process data. While a number of resilience metrics have already been put forward, little experimental evidence is available when it comes to the cyber security of CPSs. By using the model of a real wastewater treatment plant, and simulating attacks that tamper with a critical feedback control loop, we provide a comparison between four resilience indexes selected through a thorough literature review involving over 40 papers. Our results show that the selected indexes differ in terms of behavior and sensitivity with respect to specific attacks, but they can all summarize and extract meaningful information from bulky system logs.

Traditional inspection methods are time-consuming and prone to errors due to limited labor expertise. Therefore, to tackle these challenges, harnessing advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning/Deep Learning (ML/DL), and Internet of Things (IoT) is essential for managing and mitigating agriculture hazards. This research presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art DL architectures integrated with IoT-based systems applied to plant pest and disease detection (PPDD) by investigating different potential approaches that have been employed using DL and IoT up to the year 2024 to address challenges in agriculture. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for image recognition, object detection, and their integration with IoT, embedded into mobile devices and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are explored. Moreover, the research discusses the advantages and limitations of these techniques, emphasizing their architecture design, efficiency and accuracy. The findings demonstrate that there is a tradeoff between robustness and complexity among existing techniques, and authors recommend future trends aimed at creating robust models with fewer parameters that are more accurate and easily implementable on small IoT-based and portable devices suitable for in-field and real-time applications. Furthermore, while existing review papers discuss either DL or IoT separately, this research paper uniquely focuses on their combined models, providing a comprehensive overview of the synergistic potential of leveraging IoT-driven technologies alongside advanced DL algorithms to ease the task of researchers in the field of precision agriculture particularly in PPDD.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3455244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10666658","Deep learning;machine learning;crop pest detection;crop disease detection;convolutional neural networks;Internet of Things","Crops;Internet of Things;Reviews;Agriculture;Image recognition;Accuracy;Deep learning;Plant diseases;Convolutional neural networks","","4","","187","CCBY","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spontaneous egg spawning by the chickens is viewed as a significant problem for poultry farms. Chick production may grow because of using technology to make it faster. To employ technology to hatch the eggs, a hatching incubator is implemented using the Internet of Things (IoT). During the course of around 21 days, hens manually hatch eggs. An automated spawning method will reduce the time it takes for eggs to hatch. Natural techniques of incubation were never able to keep up with modern technologies. Maintaining the ideal humidity, ventilation, and temperature is crucial for simulating the natural hen incubators. It is also crucial to regularly undulate the eggs. IoT is used to connect the incubator to a remote device, which in turn controls it. To ensure that the eggs hatch in a way that resembles natural incubation, sensors within the incubator constantly monitor the temperature, humidity, and ventilation. The results shows that the proposed model can incubate eggs in an efficient and effective manner under the threshold parameters.","","979-8-3315-0754-1","10.1109/ETIS64005.2025.10961849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10961849","Internet of Things (IoT);Node MCU;Incubator;Smart objects","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Accuracy;Humidity;Production;Ventilation;Software;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Intelligent sensors","","","","11","IEEE","21 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As these devices are connected to internet, security is the major concern. IoT devices will be vulnerable to all kind of active and passive attacks. In continuation, this paper proposes a secured protocol based on elliptic curve for communication between IoT devices and server. In the proposed Elliptical Curve Internet of Things (ECIOT) protocol, the IoT device will establish secret session key with server by using Diffie-Hellman protocol based on NIST p-192 prime curve. The subsequent communication will be carried out with symmetric key cipher Ex-OR by using ECIOT derived key.

The networks in the Internet of Things are severely resource constrained, particularly in terms of processing and communication capabilities. Regrettably, they are required by the Blockchain in order to achieve research objectives and disseminate blocks. We present a novel mining and cloud handling methodologies in this study to address the aforementioned challenge in the Blockchain assisted IoT, which is called as ‘Deep Precise Networking Model (DPNM)‘. To be more precise, miners function as data mining drivers for IoT terminals, outsource processing duties to deliver effective cloud enabled servers and flexibly allocate networking connections. Additionally, in addition to improve efficiency, the access control determination challenge, computational resource allocation algorithm and communication resource allocation issue are combined into a single optimization method.

Finally, experiments prove that this method is effective in the open Internet of Things, which can greatly enhance the security of data access between IoT sensors, and can effectively protect the privacy of network entity data.","","978-1-7281-8117-2","10.1109/TOCS50858.2020.9339621","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602456); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9339621","Internet of Things;Game theory;Access control","Access control;Information security;Games;Optics;Telecommunications;Sensors;Internet of Things","","","","24","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The integration of the IoT and social networking concept results in developing an interdisciplinary research area called the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). The SIoT is dominant over the traditional IoT because of its structure, implementation, and operational manageability. In the SIoT, devices interact with each other independently to establish a social relationship for collective goals. To establish trustworthy relationships among the devices significantly improves the interaction in the SIoT and mitigates the phenomenon of risk. The problem is to choose a trustworthy node who is most suitable according to the choice parameters of the node. The best-selected node by one node is not necessarily the most suitable node for other nodes, as the trustworthiness of the node is independent for everyone. We employ some theoretical characterization of the soft-set theory to deal with this kind of decision-making problem. In this paper, we developed a weighted based trustworthiness ranking model by using soft set theory to evaluate the trustworthiness in the SIoT. The purpose of the proposed research is to reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions by identifying the most trusted nodes.","","978-1-7281-4743-7","10.1109/ICCC47050.2019.9064242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064242","internet of things;trust;social internet of things;soft set theory;trust decision making","Internet of Things;Set theory;Social network services;Wireless sensor networks;Measurement;Bitcoin;Decision making","","12","","28","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data are one of the most important commodities in IoT. To maximize the utility of the collected data, it is crucial to design an open IoT data market that enables data owners and consumers to carry out data trading securely and efficiently. To address the challenge of security presented by an untrusted and nontransparent data market, we propose an edge/cloud-computing-assisted, blockchain-enhanced data market framework to support secure and efficient IoT data trading, with a particular focus on an optimal pricing mechanism. In this mechanism, an authorized market-agency works as a scheduler, determining the win-owner and its pricing strategy to the consumer. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to solve the pricing and purchasing problem of the data consumer and the market-agency. In the first stage of the game, the market-agency gives the win-owner and its pricing strategy. In the second stage, the data consumer decides on its purchasing quantity of data.

This article presents a comprehensive analysis through a systematic review of ontologies and key security attributes essential for modelling the security of IIoT environments. Our review includes an extensive analysis of research articles, semantic security ontologies, and cybersecurity standards. Through this analysis, we identify critical security concepts and attributes, which can be leveraged to develop standardised security ontologies tailored for IIoT. Additionally, we explore the potential of integrating ontologies into the Industry 5.0 paradigm, which emphasises human-centricity, resilience, and sustainability. While ontologies offer structured modelling capabilities, their alignment with Industry 5.0’s unique collaborative and adaptive security needs remains limited. Our review suggests that existing security ontologies are not fully aligned with security goals, exposing many important research gaps.

Dynamic reconfiguration of real-time systems requires both functional and temporal correctness. A lengthy disruption of real-time behaviors caused by a reconfiguration can cause the system to fail. We describe the scheduling problem for a component-based real-time industrial control system on the basis of the IEC 61499 and extend this problem to handle disruptions introduced by a dynamic reconfiguration. We show that the disruption can be quantified by applying the Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP) and calculating the blocking time. Further, we show that the order of operations within a reconfiguration sequence can be optimized using the blocking time as objective function. An evaluation on two example systems shows that our model allows the application of common schedulability tests for Rate Monotonic scheduling. In our examples, the optimization reduces the blocking time of a task during reconfiguration compared to a heuristic topological ordering by up to 85%. This makes previously infeasible reconfigurations feasible. The results imply that timing analysis of dynamic reconfiguration for component-based real-time systems is attainable, and further research is necessary to extend it for distributed systems.","","978-1-6654-9770-1","10.1109/ICPS51978.2022.9816872","Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany(grant numbers:01IS18063B); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816872","Downtimeless System Evolution;Dynamic Soft-ware Updating;Dynamic Reconfiguration;Timing Analysis","Adaptation models;Job shop scheduling;Automation;Industrial control;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems;Behavioral sciences","","6","","16","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is very necessary to fully inspect the Internet of Things system before it is actually deployed, so as to find the errors and defects in the system design as soon as possible and make improvements. Compared with conventional simulation and testing, the formal method has the advantages of low cost, short cycle and simple steps, which provides efficient support for the inspection and analysis of the Internet of Things system before deployment. Based on the stateful timed communication sequence process (STCSP), we consider the formal modeling framework for the Internet of things system from the perspective of external environment input and system architecture. We then propose a hierarchical formal modeling method for the Internet of things system oriented to user behavior. Taking the elderly home monitoring application scene as an example, as the input of the external environment, the user behavior and its implementation object are combined into a whole for modeling, so as to keep the two states in sync, restrict each other, and avoid unrealistic sequence of activities. From the perspectives of perception mode, communication mode, predefined rules and application services, we have completed the hierarchical modeling of the three-layer architecture of the Internet of Things system, that is, perception layer, middle layer and application layer. Finally, the model verification tool PAT analyzes and verifies the above model from the aspects of security, accessibility, and system consistency.

In this paper, we propose a CJ scheme for IoT systems to fight against multiple passive and collusive eavesdroppers of unknown channel state information. Considering nodes with multi-antenna in an IoT system, we design beamforming vectors to maximize signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the wireless link from a controller (transmitter) to an actuator (receiver). Under the worst-case assumption that eavesdroppers can aggregate all signals to enhance their eavesdropping abilities, we derive the closed- form expressions of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) with and without CJ. In addition, we employ a strict mathematical asymptotic analysis to provide insights into the effects of various system parameters on the SOP. Numerical results verify that the CJ scheme can effectively prevent eavesdropping and the effects of system parameters on SOP is consistent with theoretical analytical results.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014015","","Jamming;Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Security;Internet of Things;Wireless communication;Closed-form solutions","","6","","18","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In previous work, using computer simulation, we have shown that collisions occur between packets transmitted by the IoT devices, as a result of the poor frequency stability caused by the cheap oscillator. Moreover, we have previously proposed an algorithm that enables an IoT device to modify its communication cycle: a regular packet transmission is delayed by predicting the interval between received packets at a gateway. However, packets from the device whose transmission timing is modified collide with the following packets from other IoT devices, and the total number of modifications is greatly increased by this algorithm.

The complex systems and interfaces create emergent behavior that will affect the key performance attributes of Performance, Discard Rate, Observed over Expected Kidney Transplants, Affordability, and Acceptability. These key performance attributes, interfaces, and rules are developed from multiple interviews and events with the systems’ stakeholders. We used fuzzy membership functions to assess the performance of the systems and then optimized them using genetic algorithms.

Business and engineering considerations are both increasing the volumes and detail of IoT data flows. Reasonably obvious privacy risks result from IoT-connected devices when they emit identifiable information, for this can reveal the activities of device users. More subtle risks arise when bulk device data is available for analysis, and linkage to auxiliary data sets, because identification or re-identification of users can follow. At the same time, security engineers are now designing for the “Identity of Things”, exploiting embedded cryptography and SIM-like modules to help with the authentication and authorization of devices acting as independent agents in the IoT. To help protect privacy while allowing precise authentication, this paper sets out a new model for digital identity management, comprising a stack of identities, attributes, and attribute metadata. As with the familiar OSI network stack, the digital identity stack helps to decouple different layers of authentication technology, so that IoT data is shared on an explicit need-to-know basis, and extraneous disclosures are minimized.","","978-1-4673-9944-9","10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8355199","Internet of Things;authentication;security;privacy;digital signatures;public key infrastructure","Authentication;Privacy;Metadata;Sensors;Internet of Things;Cryptography;Protocols","","8","","24","IEEE","7 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper provides some background on the role of CPS in ICS and the use of simulation in the evaluation of existing systems and the testing of proposed designs. It then provides a solution for some of the current functionality gaps in CPS network simulation in the form of a module add-on for the commonly used hydraulic simulator toolkit, the Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR).

However, existing edge storage models cannot offer the security-aware data robustness and the adaptable data sharing among many uncertain users, due to the limitations of the utilized fault-tolerant storage technologies and the access control methods. In this article, we propose a secure and trust-oriented edge storage model, which would efficiently tackle the aforementioned two challenging issues in the IoT environment. More precisely, we first propose a robust and secure edge storage (RoSES) model using the totally local reconstruction code (TLRC) method presented in this article. It can achieve data robustness, high security, and lightweight computation at end devices. We further propose a trust-oriented data access (TODA) strategy for our RoSES model, which supports a wide and adaptable range of legitimate data accesses from uncertain requesters for IoT data sharing. We conduct extensive comparison and simulations to evaluate the performance of our new edge storage models. The results show that our model can efficiently realize the data storage, data recovery, and data sharing at the network edge, saving about 35% of storage cost and 76% degraded read latency.

One of these novel devices is the IIoT edge gateway, which is used to connect critical physical systems with the cyber world, and to provide consistent storage, processing, and analytical and controlling capabilities. However, these devices also come with new and advanced threats such as targeted ransomware. In this paper, we investigate this threat in detail. We studied the threat actors' motivations, the anatomy of ransomware for edge gateways, and the likelihood of such ransomware attack to happen in the future. We found that threat actors find IIoT edge gateways attractive ransomware targets due to their vital roles and functionalities in working with critical infrastructure and that the likelihood of such attack to occur is high. We built the first version of a ransomware security testbed for IIoT, and for test purposes, we developed a first version of ransomware target at IIoT edge gateway in a brownfield system. From our measurements we conclude that kernel-related activity parameters are significant indicators of the abnormal behavior caused by crypto-ransomware attacks in IIoT edge gateways, much more so even than for similar attacks in information technology server workstation.

In this article, a QoE-aware satellite constellation design scheme is proposed to enhance the user satisfaction by constructing QoE factors. First, an SIoT network model is established with low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the problem is formulated to calculate the QoE for different areas after analyzing the dynamic network topology. Then, the QoE factors are defined to assess QoE by taking into account the coverage performance, communication fluency, regional demand capacity, and profitability. Following that, an intelligent optimization algorithm named multilayer tabu search (MLTS) is designed to obtain reasonable satellite orbits with the best QoE, which provides orbit parameters for satellite constellation configuration. The simulation results demonstrate that the designed satellite constellation can effectively improve the users QoE by optimizing the various QoE factors.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3030263","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601075,61671092); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222141","Intelligent optimization;Quality of Experience (QoE);satellite constellation design;Satellite Internet of Things (SIoT)","Satellites;Quality of experience;Satellite constellations;Network topology;Internet of Things;Orbits;Low earth orbit satellites","","50","","31","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This lack of IIoT device security standards is a major concern. Due to the nature of these infrastructures and impact of compromises, CI device security is an utmost concern and must be focused on during all phases of development and manufacturing as opposed to the addition of security after functional design as seen with many current Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Many of these sensors and devices have limited resources, such as low power consumption, reduced memory storage, and reduced fixed-point processing capabilities. Traditional security protocols and solutions are often not practical on these restrained devices, and there are no current standards for characterizing device security. This paper presents a candidate security level-based architecture for low power IoT-CI devices implementing modular, low power, security primitives that are shown through simulation models and embedded software implementation to create a robustly layered defense-in-depth IoT architecture. This candidate architecture will help provide a foundation for future CI-IoT device security standardization.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2903242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8660501","Critical infrastructure (CI);encryption;industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);low-power;physical layer security;secure architecture","Security;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Standards;Performance evaluation","","34","","89","IEEE","5 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using signal characteristics, one of the D2D gadgets is selected as a friendly jammer to improve the secrecy performance of a cellular device. In return, the selected D2D gadget is allowed to reuse spectrum resources of the cellular device. Using social relationship, we analyze and quantify the social intimacy degree among the nodes in IoT to design an adaptive communication time threshold. Applying an artificial intelligence forecasting model, we further forecast and update the intimacy degree, and then screen and filter potential devices to effectively reduce the detection and calculation costs. Finally, we propose an optimal scheme to integrate the virtual social relationship with actual communication systems. To select the optimal D2D gadget as a friendly jammer, we apply Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm to solve the maximization problem of social intimacy and cooperative jamming.

Logistics and sustainment are traditionally brought into the IoT conversation through asset tracking, transportation, and Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS). However the IoT has additional aspects that can be related to logistics information systems and automated test. In relation to Automated Test Systems, the IoT can be a valuable component while an ATS may also use IoT concepts and capabilities within its own architecture. ATSs are applicable in all layers of the IoT: sensing, networking / communications, and applications. An ATS can be a sensor in the IoT serving to inform sustaining engineering, product support management, maintenance planning, and supply chain decisions through its test and diagnostic data. In addition, many ATSs consist of a network of instrumentation and measurement devices that can serve as part of the IoT network / communication layer. And finally an automated test and diagnostic application can be used in the IoT to expand the scale of testing beyond standard automated test capability. This paper describes and analyzes the implementation of Automated Test Systems in all three IoT layers. The described ATS / IoT interactions elicit multiple benefits and challenges. The ubiquity and diversity of sensors in the Internet of Things allows for a new scope of testing across an enterprise, correlation of asset usage and repair, supply chain prognostics, and opportunities for deep learning. Challenges inevitably include cybersecurity and the analysis of overwhelming data. The paper also outlines how these concepts extend to related topics such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Everything (IoE).

The platform devotes to provide data representation and interpretability analysis for different stakeholders to achieve flexibility and scalability; simultaneously, to improve thermal comfort while reducing building power consumption. The platform manages data from the IoT devices and builds energy management systems using a cloud-based, user-friendly human-computer interaction interface. Decisions on how to optimize the operation of building energy systems are becoming increasingly complex. Data-driven predictive control (DPC) is a control technology that replaces conventional strategies, such as rule-based control and model-based predictive control (MPC). When applied to complex building operations, control-oriented data-driven models are used to implement finite time receding horizon control. This paper adopts the CatBoost algorithm for model prediction, which is highly interpretable and easy to operate for different stakeholders. A numerical simulation case study is utilized to compare the control performance, such as the residential building power consumption, R Squares, RMSE, and Test time, with other strategies: XGBoost, TDNN, LightGBM.

However, the burgeoning number of internet-connected devices within the IoT ecosystem presents significant challenges in safeguarding consumer privacy and security. This growing attack surface exposes vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are prominent threats within the IoT landscape. In a DoS attack, attackers overwhelm a device or network with a flood of illegitimate requests, hindering legitimate users from accessing services. A DDoS attack amplifies this disruption by leveraging numerous compromised systems to launch a coordinated assault. The dynamic nature of DoS attacks, coupled with the inherent complexities of the IoT environment, often render existing security solutions ineffective, allowing attackers to circumvent them. This paper proposes a novel approach to address these challenges. We present a mathematical model for DoS attack detection within the IoT, leveraging queuing theory principles. This model forms the foundation for a multi-hierarchical firewall architecture designed to safeguard IoT devices. The firewall incorporates a distributed service architecture to enhance its ability to handle concurrent requests.

Using forward and backward propagation of the these variables, an accurate state estimation is obtained.

Through IoT, these applications have consolidated in the modern world to generate, share, aggregate and analyze large amount of security-critical and privacy sensitive data. As this consolidation gets stronger, the need for security in IoT increases. With first line of defense strategies like cryptography being unsuited due to the resource constrained nature, second line of defense mechanisms are crucial to ensure security in IoT networks. This paper presents a comprehensive study of existing second line of defense mechanisms for standardized protocols in IoT networks. The paper analyzes existing mechanisms in three aspects: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and Intrusion Response Systems (IRS). We begin by providing an overview of standardized protocol stack, its layers and defensive security systems in IoT. From there, we build our narrative by presenting an extended taxonomy of IDS, IPS and IRS classifying them on their techniques, deployment, attacks, datasets, evaluation metrics and data pre-processing methods. We then thoroughly review, compare and analyze the research proposals in this context, considering the unique characteristics involved in these systems. Based on the extensive analysis of the existing defensive security systems, the paper also identifies open research challenges and directions for effective design of such systems for IoT networks, which could guide future research in the area.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3005643","MobiWise Project: From Mobile Sensing to Mobility Advising(grant numbers:P2020 SAICTPAC/0011/2015); COMPETE 2020, Portugal 2020-POCI, European Union’s ERDF; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127958","Internet of Things;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;intrusion response;Internet of Things Security;standardized protocols","Internet of Things;Protocols;IP networks;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Intrusion detection","","28","","189","CCBY","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The growing demand for power in the current environment has necessitated the mandatory installation of energy meters, as well as the development of new methods for calibrating meter readings and governing the effective use of energy resources. AMR (Automatic Meter Reading system) is one such modernization. This employs analogue or digital energy meters with the assistance of smart meters. Currently, energy scaling is done by hand, which is a timeconsuming process in the world of day-to-day networking demand and also requires skilled labour. The concept of AMR Systems is to overcome complexities in the rapidly growing field of energy management. This article proposes a smart energy meter based on IoT to detect the power theft. The proposed model consists of Arduino UNO, ESP8266, AC713 current sensors, and so on. The AC713 senses current usage with the help of the ESP32, which is then passed to the IoT platform. Though AMR is a very effective method, it costs the proxy of existing energy meters by SEM (Smart energy meters), which is highly inefficient. As a result, the proposed method focuses on detecting the power theft caused by public tampering. The proposed model is programmed by using a BLYNK software and simulated in PROTEUS software. The proposed system is then validated by using the simulated results.","","978-1-6654-7451-1","10.1109/IDCIoT56793.2023.10053541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10053541","Internet of Things (IoT);Arduino UNO;energy meter;LCD;current sensor","Meters;Software;Smart meters;Sensor systems;Liquid crystal displays;Internet of Things;Reliability","","9","","15","IEEE","1 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In essence, blockchain supports a decentralized platform maintained by peers instead of a single entity. Furthermore, the data in the blockchain is immutable and is being held in a secure and encrypted way. However, running the blockchain on resource-limited devices, such as a consumer PC or a low-power Raspberry Pi as opposed to dedicated servers, is demanding due to the resource limitation in energy, memory, and time taken to validate the transaction on the blockchain. This paper explores these limitations by evaluating and benchmarking the blockchain framework Geth: a terminal interface for the Ethereum blockchain which makes it possible to create a private blockchain in addition to joining the actual blockchain. This article employs a private blockchain within Geth and benchmarks the blockchain to highlight the differences (and limitations) between the devices. Specifically, we make the following observations: (i) the time it takes to validate and add the transaction to the blockchain on a Raspberry Pi 4 is markedly slower compared to an Intel i9-10885H CPU @ 2.40GHz, (ii) the transaction between PCs compared to transactions between Pis is around two orders of magnitude higher. These valuable insights can be used to help researchers in the design and implementation of blockchain-driven security architectures for distributed systems, such as industrial IoT deployments and UAV swarms.","","978-1-6654-7038-4","10.1109/CPS-IoTBench56135.2022.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9805384","Blockchain;IoT;Geth","Performance evaluation;Power demand;Consensus algorithm;Benchmark testing;Cyber-physical systems;Proof of Work;Blockchains","","1","","15","IEEE","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite these improvements, there remains a persistent need for systems that are not only reliable but also incorporate multiple layers of security to prevent unauthorized access and use. This research paper introduces GPS and GSM based tracking system designed to significantly enhance vehicle safety and provide real time location monitoring. The system utilizes an Arduino Uno as the primary control unit, interfaced with a GSM module (SIM800L) for communication and a GPS module (NEO-6M) for precise tracking of the vehicle's location. Key components include a relay-controlled ignition switch and a key lock system to manage vehicle startup, a fingerprint sensor for advanced biometric authentication, and a buzzer for auditory alerts. The entire system operates on a 9$V$ power supply, with voltage regulation managed by an LM2596 step-down converter. This integration of hardware components ensures robust vehicle tracking, remote control capabilities, and heightened security measures, thereby offering an effective solution for personal vehicle safety and efficient fleet management.

They emerge from the arrangement of independent and useful physical systems integrated into a larger system that delivers unique capabilities such as multi-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or robotic swarms. Successful collaboration and interaction between component systems in (increasingly) reduced spaces is contingent to precise and accurate perception, interpretation and management of various spatial representations of self and teaming systems. This is needed for effective decision making (the right action at the right time, and in the right place) for keeping safety-critical SoS safe. Thus, we develop and propose space-based interaction functions to model and evaluate the spatial properties and interactions of systems (as agents) within a safety-critical SoS.

There is an opportunity to utilize discarded kidneys, with roughly twenty percent of kidneys discarded each year. A real-time generation of an optimized architecture is desired to assist kidney allocation. Current practice for allocating high-risk deceased donor kidneys requires organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to engage in a prolonged manual process, accruing cold ischemic time and exacerbating kidney quality. An interactive digital simulation tool is developed to identify high-risk kidneys that are hard to place and justify starting the accelerated placement process sooner. The simulation tool will estimate the increased likelihood of placement and improve the current allocation model by providing a systematic basis for changing the current process and demonstrating how simulation can be leveraged to evaluate a policy change before implementation. The simulation meta-architecture and AI were all integrated on the Anylogic platform to conduct real-time optimization and prediction of the kidney transplant system of systems. This integrated simulation allows UNOS to generate optimized policies for the kidney transplant systems of systems. Future work includes validating and verifying the platform with additional stakeholders and testing different policies with UNOS.","2835-3161","979-8-3503-2723-6","10.1109/SoSE59841.2023.10178576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10178576","meta-architecture;artificial intelligence;optimization;organ transplant;system of systems","Systematics;Digital simulation;Real-time systems;Organ transplantation;Resource management;Modeling;Artificial intelligence","","","","28","IEEE","17 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"System of Systems for Distributed Disaggregated Communications via Reinforcement Learning and Backpressure (D2CRaB)","M. -C. Wang; P. C. Hershey",Raytheon Technologies; Raytheon Technologies,2023 18th Annual System of Systems Engineering Conference (SoSe),"17 Jul 2023","2023","","","1","7","This paper focuses on effectively communicating within distributed and disaggregated multi-domain battlespace operational system of systems (SoS) environments. To do so, the individual participating communications systems must be adaptive in response to ever-changing on-mission events such as, network congestion (e.g., degraded comms links and excessive network traffic), enemy interference (e.g., jamming, cyber-attacks), line of sight degradation (e.g., weather conditions). These challenges cause traditional communications systems networks to drop packets, which they presently do according to pre-specified Quality of Service (QoS) policies. However, these QoS policies alone do not actually mitigate the congestion problem because the impacted streams employ reliable communications protocols, such as TCP, that require dropped packets to be retransmitted over the same route. This approach can make the congestion problem even worse and waste the valuable bandwidth. The approach presented here introduces the novel System of Systems (SoS) for Distributed Disaggregated Communications via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Backpressure (D2CRaB) to overcome the above stated limitations. D2CRaB does so in two ways: (1) by bridging route selection and congestion control via a new backpressure scheme and (2) by leveraging RL to enable the dynamic and continuous adaptation to changing network conditions. These new advancements, greatly extend the available bandwidth of the original congested communications system to that available of other communications systems within the multi-domain SoS. By so doing, congestion can be relieved, and packet drops can be greatly reduced.","2835-3161","979-8-3503-2723-6","10.1109/SoSE59841.2023.10178551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10178551","Distributed;Disaggregated;Communications;System of Systems;Multi-Domain;QoS;Backpressure;Reinforcement Learning","Quality of service;Reinforcement learning;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Interference;Routing protocols;Reliability","","","","12","IEEE","17 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective is to minimize energy consumption and communication overhead of monitoring, for each node. Several subsets of the potential monitoring nodes are generated by solving a minimal vertex cover (VC) problem with constraint generation. Assuming periodical functioning, VCs are optimally assigned to time periods in order to distribute the monitoring role throughout the entire network. The assignment of VCs to periods is modeled as a multiobjective generalized assignment problem. To further optimize the energy consumption of the monitors, they are sequenced across time periods to minimize the state transitions of nodes. This part of the problem is modeled as a traveling salesman path problem.

The data collector relates to the embedded system device (or the `things' element) at the source of the application, the communication method relates to the network protocol used to send or receive the data and the cloud platform service relates to the facility used to store and process the data collected. LoRaWan and LoRa are `Long Range' technologies, which define the communication method for such IoT applied systems. LoRa defines the modulation technique, that allows for long range communication, whereas LoRaWan defines the communication and system architecture.This paper presents the design architecture and methodology of a fully functioning LoRaWan based IoT system.

In this work, a preamble-based GF IoT system is considered, where the total number of users in the system correspond to two categories - (i) fixed and (ii) random (modelled using a Poisson distribution). Analytical expressions are derived for the number of preambles required for GF access in each of the categories, such that the user transmissions are successful with high probability.

Green house monitoring is one of the most in demand usages of IoT, as it decreases monitoring maintain cost and error. Automatic greenhouse monitoring helps to constantly manage environmental factors and reduce energy costs without human error. Data returned by IoT system could be transferred to regression task in order to analysis the relation between inputs and targets alongside with its correlation coefficient. At the same time these data could be clustered into similar groups, in order to make data easily understood and manipulated. To employ these two tasks, a new bio-inspired algorithm is introduced. Proposed Bee-Eater Hunting (BEH) Algorithm, not only can compete with famous evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) but also, returns more optimized cost in comparison with other algorithms. Live data returned by ThingSpeak platform, sends to proposed Bio-inspired BEH algorithm for fuzzy regression and cluster analysis task and compares with other algorithms. Results shows considerable improvement in both tasks.","","978-1-6654-8891-4","10.1109/SCIoT56583.2022.9953726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9953726","Internet of Things;Greenhouse monitoring;Bee-Eater Hunting Algorithm;Fuzzy Regression;Clustering","Correlation coefficient;Costs;Smart cities;Green products;Clustering algorithms;Evolutionary computation;Internet of Things","","1","","29","IEEE","21 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But its rapid growth has created several security problems, with respect to the transmission and storage of vast amounts of customers data, across an insecure heterogeneous collection of networks. The Internet of Things is therefore creating a unique set of risk and problems that will affect most households. From breaches in confidentiality, which could allow users to be snooped on, through to failures in integrity, which could lead to consumer data being compromised; devices are presenting many security challenges to which consumers are ill equipped to protect themselves from. Moreover, when this is coupled with the heterogeneous nature of the industry, and the interoperable and scalability problems it becomes apparent that the Internet of Things has created an increased attack surface from which security vulnerabilities may be easily exploited. However, it has been conjectured that blockchain may provide a solution to the Internet of Things security and scalability problems. Because of blockchain's immutability, integrity and scalability, it is possible that its architecture could be used for the storage and transfer of Internet of Things data.

In this work, we present a multi-tier methodology consisting of an authentication and trust-building/distribution framework designed to ensure the safety and validity of the information exchanged in the system. Blockchain protocols and Radio Frequency-Distinct Native Attributes (RF-DNA) combine to provide a hardware-software codesigned system for enhanced device identity and overall system trustworthiness. Our threat model accounts for counterfeiting, breakout fraud, and bad mouthing of one entity by others. Entity trust (e.g., IoT devices) depends on quality and level of participation, quality of messages, lifetime of a given entity in the system, and the number of known ""bad"" (non-consensus) messages sent by that entity. Based on this approach to trust, we are able to adjust trust upward and downward as a function of real-time and past behavior, providing other participants with a trust value upon which to judge information from and interactions with the given entity. This approach thereby reduces the potential for manipulation of an IoT system by a bad or byzantine actor.","","978-1-7281-2980-8","10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8875291","Blockchain;IoT;RF-DNA Fingerprinting;Trust management","Blockchain;Transmitters;Support vector machines;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Trust management","","19","","43","IEEE","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The architecture of the Internet of Things is inflexible and scalable, and many types of devices connected to the network are sensitive to latency and bandwidth requirements. Internet of Things network management. Therefore, fine-grained and accurate traffic information is very important for the network management of the Internet of things. Software defined network (SDN) is a centralized control plane as the logic control center, making network management more flexible and efficient. Then, we collect fine-grained traffic information in the SDN-based Internet of things network to improve network management. In order to obtain traffic information with low overhead and high accuracy, we first collect coarse-grained traffic flow statistics, link fine-grained traffic, and then use intelligent optimization methods to improve traffic granularity and accuracy. Information. Since the optimization function of traffic information is NP-hard problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm to obtain the optimal solution of fine granularity measurement. Finally, some simulations validate the proposed measurement scheme. Simulation results show that this method can improve the granularity and accuracy of traffic information through intelligent optimization.","","978-1-7281-2977-8","10.1109/ICII.2019.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9065099","internet-of-things;SDN;intelligent-optimization;network-measurement;heuristic-algorithm","Telecommunication traffic;Switches;Internet of Things;Genetic algorithms;Transforms;Optimization","","1","","19","IEEE","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, their inability to ensure security and decline in communication efficiency and response time with the increase in the size of IoT network are some of the many concerning weaknesses that are holding back the fast-paced growth of IoT. Realizing the limitations of centralized systems, recently blockchain-based decentralized architecture is being considered as the key to redesigning the IoT systems in a way that is designed to be secure, transparent, highly resistant to outages, auditable, and efficient. However, before realizing the new promise of blockchain for IoT, there are significant challenges to address. One fundamental challenge is the scale issue around data collection, storage, and analytic as IoT sensor devices possess limited computational power and storage capabilities. In particular, since the chain is always growing, IoT devices require more and more resources. Thus, an oversized chain poses storage and scalability problems. With this in mind, the overall goal of our research is to design a lightweight scalable blockchain framework for IoT of mobile devices.

In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Graph Data Service for the Internet of Things Middleware to handle the above challenges. First, a new IoT middleware is proposed to bridge the data between non-smart devices and the Internet of Things for the accessing challenge. Second, the data from non-smart devices are then integrated into a knowledge graph-based database with unified web service APIs to solve the heterogeneity problem. Finally, the proposed system is applied to a real-world rural sewage treatment project. The system has been deployed to 19 rural sewage treatment sites and runs stably.

All the layers of IoT are vulnerable to severely disruptive attacks. However, the attacks in IoT Network layer have a high impact on communication between the connected objects. Routing in most of the IoT networks is carried out by IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). RPL-based IoT offers limited protection against routing attacks. A trust-based approach for routing security is suitable to be integrated with IoT systems due to the resource-constrained nature of devices. This research proposes a trust-based secure routing protocol to provide security against packet dropping attacks in RPL-based IoT networks. IoT networks are dynamic and consist of both static and mobile nodes. Hence the chosen trust metrics in the proposed method also include the mobility-based metrics for trust evaluation. The proposed solution is integrated into RPL as a modified objective function, and the results are compared with the default RPL objective function, MRHOF.

Nevertheless, due to lack of mobility support in the IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPLs), which is standardized for multihop IoT infrastructures, providing reliable communications in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR) in mobile IoT applications has become significantly challenging. While several studies tried to enhance the adaptability of RPL to network dynamics, their utilized routing metrics have prevented them from establishing long-lasting reliable paths. Furthermore, the stochastic parent replacement policy in the standard version of RPL has intensified this challenge. Aside from this, due to the existing tradeoff between reliability and power efficiency, most of the existing approaches have only concentrated on one of these concerns without paying attention to the other one. To address these issues, this article introduces ARMOR, a routing mechanism built upon RPL, which employs a novel mobility-aware routing metric, i.e., time to reside (TTR), and a corresponding parent replacement policy. According to the motion characteristics of the mobile objects, TTR provides an estimation of how long the nodes will be in the transmission range of each other. This enables ARMOR to select nodes, which provide longer connection period and consequently higher reliability. In comparison with the state of the art, while keeping the power consumption constant, ARMOR significantly improves the amount of PDR in the network by up to  $2.5\times $ , while it enhances the reliability against the original version of this protocol by up to  $4.2\times $ .","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3088346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9451181","Embedded devices;Internet of Things (IoT);mobility;neighbor table replacement;power efficiency;reliability;routing;routing protocol for low-power and lossy network (RPL)","Internet of Things;Routing;Measurement;Software reliability;Standards;Topology;Routing protocols","","24","","52","IEEE","10 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sensors are connected with each other through the Internet that leads to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). As the time passes, the number of deployed sensors is exponentially increasing. Not only this, the enhancement of sensors has also laid the base of automation. However, the increased number of sensors make the IoT networks more complex and scaled. Due to the increasing size and complexity, IoT networks of scale-free nature are found highly prone to attacks. In order to maintain the functionality of crucial applications, it is mandatory to increase the robustness of IoT networks. Additionally, it has been found that scale-free networks are resistant to random attacks. However, they are highly vulnerable to intentional, malicious, deliberate, targeted and cyber attacks where nodes are destroyed based on preference. Moreover, sensors of IoT network have limited communication, processing and energy resources. Hence, they cannot bear the load of computationally extensive robustness algorithms. A communication model is proposed in this paper to save the sensors from computational overhead of robustness algorithms by migrating the computational load to back-end high power processing clusters. Elephant Herding Robustness Evolution (EHRE) algorithm is proposed based on an enhanced communication model. In the proposed work, 6 phases of operations are used: initialization, sorting, clan updating, clan separating,selection and formation, and filtration. These process collectively increase the robustness of the scale-free IoT networks.

Using cryptographic methods to ensure data confidentiality is one of the most common ways for mitigating data confidentiality attacks. Since traditional encryption approaches need important CPU and memory capacity as well as increasing time and energy consumption, researchers have developed a variety of lightweight cryptographic algorithms to provide IoT environments with solutions that take into consideration IoT resources limitations while offering adapted security level. Managing lightweight cryptographic features in an IoT ecosystem is extremely difficult due to the large number of objects, the nature of IoT devices that do not accept the implementation of all possible lightweight solutions, the heterogeneity of the captured data, and the energy required for these lightweight solutions. To address this problem, we propose a novel IoT framework in which lightweight cryptographic features are self-managed according to the Autonomic Computing paradigm in order to ensure IoT data confidentiality while enhancing IoT system performance and extending IoT device lifetime.","","978-1-6654-6495-6","10.1109/SITIS57111.2022.00078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090165","Internet of Things;IoT data confidentiality;Autonomic Computing;Self-management;IoT architecture","Data privacy;Energy consumption;System performance;Ecosystems;Memory management;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","","","11","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Put in other words, it does not require unrealistic assumptions about absolute preventative protection of complex cyber-physical platforms that would disable any type of malicious penetration and damage against the physical plant at the first place. Instead, resilience is based on the assumption that a sophisticated intrusion may succeed to evade the deployed protection and runtime detection mechanisms and impact the underlying system services and assets partially (except the core sub-functionalities). The resilient system fights back through reactive and proactive intrusion tolerance mechanisms to respond to ongoing misbehaviors and recover the affected system services and components within a reasonable time interval. In this paper, we present a formal definition of resilience and assessment metric for resilience. Our resilience metric quantifies the ability of the system to recover from an attack provided the attack is discovered within a fixed time interval, as well as the cost of recovery. We analyze the metric properties for linear systems and linear systems with actuator saturation. We then formulate cyber defense policies that ensure the resilience conditions are satisfied and validate our approach using a power system case study.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2017.2776279","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS 1446471,1453046); U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-OE0000780); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8118199","Cyber-physical systems;cyber security;intrusion resilience","Resilience;Measurement;Security;Engines;Smart grids;Computational modeling","","88","","29","IEEE","22 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such an infrastructure often is a system of systems, and its functionality critically depends on the inherent robustness of its constituent systems and its defense strategy for countering attacks. Additionally, interdependencies between the systems play another critical role in determining the infrastructure robustness specified by its survival probability. In this paper, we develop game-theoretic models between a defender and an attacker for a generic system of systems using inherent parameters and conditional survival probabilities that characterize the interdependencies. We derive Nash Equilibrium conditions for the cases of interdependent and independent systems of systems under sum-form utility functions. We derive expressions for the infrastructure survival probability that capture its dependence on cost and system parameters, and also on dependencies that are specified by conditional probabilities. We apply the results to cyber-physical systems which show the effects on system survival probability due to defense and attack intensities, inherent robustness, unit cost, target valuation, and interdependencies.","","978-0-9964-5270-0","10.23919/ICIF.2017.8009876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8009876","","Robustness;Games;System of systems;Biological system modeling;Mathematical model;Nash equilibrium;Security","","","","35","","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the Internet of Things (IoT), where devices collaborate with each other to offer multiple services, TRS solve the issues of access control, decision making, reliable service delivery etc. The focus of this paper is towards robust indirect trust computation in a service-oriented, dynamic IoT environment. We propose a robust recommendation aggregation scheme which alleviates the effect of false or dishonest recommendations in indirect trust computation by performing the objective and subjective evaluation. In the objective evaluation, the value of a received recommendation is weighted by computing deviation from the average value of all the recommendation received. Subjective evaluation is performed to weight the recommender based on their age of interaction. The scheme deploys a retraining module which retrains the credibility of a recommender based on the dissimilarity experienced with the outcome of recommendation.

In DDB, we consider the demand of the AP, and let Wi-Fi station and backscatter tag contend for the channel in a separate and distributed manner. In particular, when the AP needs to read the information of backscatter tag, only tag is allowed to contend for the channel in a distributed manner. When the AP does not need to read such information, however, only the Wi-Fi station is allowed to contend for the channel in a distributed manner. Extensive simulation results verify that our protocol is feasible, and our protocol can outperform the related protocol in terms of both per-node throughput and system throughput.","","978-1-5386-8543-3","10.1109/SmartIoT.2018.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8465518","IoT;backscatter;demand;MAC;Wi-Fi","Backscatter;Wireless fidelity;Media Access Protocol;Internet of Things;Encoding;Throughput","","","","16","IEEE","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has led the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC71 to establish a study group to investigate future opportunities for SoSE standardization. This paper reviews the approach taken by the study group, the issues that were investigated and the recommendations from the study that will culminate in April 2016. The study addresses the current perspectives on SoSE, the state of the practice, the existing level of standardization for SoSE, and the analysis and findings of the potential need for additional SoSE standardization. In looking at the current and potential future state of SoSE standardization, the study examined the adequacy, existing support to, and gaps in current standards that support the needs of SoSE and the SoSE standardization solutions.","","978-1-4673-8727-9","10.1109/SYSOSE.2016.7542953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7542953","system of systems;system of systems engineering;engineering standards","System of systems;IEC Standards;ISO Standards;ISO","","9","","25","IEEE","15 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They measure the real world from multiple aspects, and the measured data is used to optimize commercial activity and social infrastructure. This trend is called IoT/CPS, which stands for Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems. The data are divided into two types: ""heavy data"" such as multimedia data and ""light data"" such as numerical values and strings. Demand exists to gather light data to data centers; however, traffic volume becomes a challenge. In this paper, we propose an efficient compression method targeting light data. The proposed method utilizes the structure of light data, which have ""constant,"" ""variable,"" and ""timestamp"" fields, to create an efficient dictionary of symbols and perform column-based compression. By evaluating multiple kinds of light data sources, the proposed method can improve the compression ratio by 24% compared with a zip (Deflate) compression and achieve traffic reduction.","","978-1-5386-4980-0","10.1109/WF-IoT.2019.8767326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8767326","Internet of Things;cyber-physical system;data compression","Dictionaries;Data centers;Sensors;Encoding;Computers;Synchronization;Internet of Things","","2","","9","IEEE","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In CPS, the real world and the computing systems are connected through networks with real-time information exchange. The introduction of networking technologies in CPS has substantial advantages in terms of system efficiency, scalability, maintenance, and many more. However, CPS are vulnerable to malicious attackers intruding on the network. The attackers aim to destroy the physical systems with cyber-physical attacks, in which the main objective is to remotely cause malfunctions in physical systems through networks. Therefore, extensive research on cyber-physical security has been conducted to detect cyber-physical attacks and guarantee the stability of the physical systems under cyber-physical attacks. In this survey, we conduct an exhaustive review of the literature on threats to CPS and on resilient CPS design strategies. First, we discuss the structure of CPS, considering physical dynamics, computing systems, and networks. Then, we provide a taxonomy of cyber-physical attacks with three properties (attack space, attack location, and stealthiness). These three attributes represent the requirements for the implementation of cyber-physical attacks. We review existing studies on anomaly-detection strategies against cyber-physical attacks in terms of physics, networks, and machine learning techniques. Moreover, we analyze the impact of typical cyber-physical attacks and the constraints on attack implementations. In particular, for each of the well-established cyber-physical attacks, we present numerical examples that clearly illustrate the time responses of the physical systems with a conventional physics-based anomaly detector. We also review advances in the typical cyber-physical attacks and the detection methods for these attacks. Furthermore, we review resilient CPS designs in the context of control theory, network management, and data-driven technologies. We conclude the survey by identifying future research directions.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2022.3187531","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant; Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1A2C1088092); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9810983","Cyber-physical systems;cyber-physical attacks;cyber-physical security;attack detection;attack resiliency","Control theory;Security;Real-time systems;Resilience;Encryption;Tutorials;Time factors","","71","","166","IEEE","30 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The urgency of this dilemma is exacerbated by shrinking defense budgets. This paper shows how the systems engineering perspective can help the decision-making process for selecting the training media equipment to construct a cost-effective training media environment. A multidisciplinary approach and systems engineering techniques were used to develop a theoretical model of the Mission Training Environment arrangement. Implications of the approach, such as that the training environment can be viewed as a system of systems and that the choice is based on combination of equipment, will be discussed.","","978-1-4673-2975-0","10.1109/SYSoSE.2012.6384171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384171","Training System;Training Environment;training media;LVC;decision-making;systems of systems","Training;Media;Modeling;Optimization;Mathematical model;Educational institutions","","2","","13","IEEE","24 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several key factors affect the value of every particular piece of work, and those factors can change over time as the actual work effort evolves, the requirements change, and the value of desired capabilities independently rise and fall. Most scheduling approaches are predictive and based on predetermined fixed values to support earned-value requirements or contracting guidelines. This paper investigates an on-demand scheduling approach with a continuous assignment of value to work. Value for work is based on current work in progress, task dependencies, resource capabilities and availability, development system capacity, and the intrinsic value of the work with respect to the capabilities under development.","","978-1-4799-5227-4","10.1109/SYSOSE.2014.6892505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892505","System of systems;scheduling;kanban;lean;value-based;software engineering;systems engineering","Systems engineering and theory;Organizations;Medical services;Scheduling;Software;Delays;Contracts","","1","","8","IEEE","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The SoS is based on a ship-to-ship communication in which ships send and receive radar images, and the SoS constructs the high quality radar images using EM algorithm. Performance was validated using a computer simulation and using radar images acquired from a single radar system at multiple locations.
